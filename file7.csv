No Easy Day puts readers alongside Owen and the other handpicked members of the twenty-four-man team as they train for the biggest mission of their lives. The blow-by-blow narrative of the assault, beginning with the helicopter crash that could have ended Owen's life straight through to the radio call confirming Bin Ladenâs death, is an essential piece of modern history.

In No Easy Day, Owen also takes readers onto the field of battle in America's ongoing War on Terror and details the selection and training process for one of the most elite units in the military. Owen's story draws on his youth in Alaska and describes the SEALs' quest to challenge themselves at the highest levels of physical and mental endurance. With boots-on-the-ground detail, Owen describes numerous previously unreported missions that illustrate the life and work of a SEAL and the evolution of the team after the events of September 11. In telling the true story of the SEALs whose talents, skills, experiences, and exceptional sacrifices led to one of the greatest victories in the War on Terror, Mark Owen honors the men who risk everything for our country, and he leaves readers with a deep understanding of the warriors who keep America safe.",non-fiction

The stranger is a Sicilian, a victim of the island's corrupt Roman governor, Verres. The senator is Marcus Ciceroâan ambitious young lawyer and spellbinding orator, who at the age of twenty-seven is determined to attain imperiumâsupreme power in the state.

Of all the great figures of the Roman world, none was more fascinating or charismatic than Cicero. And Tiroâthe inventor of shorthand and author of numerous books, including a celebrated biography of his master (which was lost in the Dark Ages)âwas always by his side.

Compellingly written in Tiro's voice, Imperium is the re-creation of his vanished masterpiece, recounting in vivid detail the story of Cicero's quest for glory, competing with some of the most powerful and intimidating figures of hisâor any otherâage: Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, and the many other powerful Romans who changed history.

Robert Harris, the world's master of innovative historical fiction, lures us into a violent, treacherous world of Roman politics at once exotically different from and yet startlingly similar to our ownâa world of Senate intrigue and electoral corruption, special prosecutors and political adventurismâto describe how one clever, compassionate, devious, vulnerable man fought to reach the top.",historical

Named a best reviewed book of 2019 by Lit Hub.

Named one of five books every high schooler should read by the School Library Journal

Ross Gayâs The Book of Delights is a genre-defying book of essaysâsome as short as a paragraph; some as long as five pagesâthat record the small joys that occurred in one year, from birthday to birthday, and that we often overlook in our busy lives. His is a meditation on delight that takes a clear-eyed view of the complexities, even the terrors, in his life, including living in America as a black man; the ecological and psychic violence of our consumer culture; the loss of those he loves. Among Gayâs funny, poetic, philosophical delights: the way Botan Rice Candy wrappers melt in your mouth, the volunteer crossing guard with a pronounced tremor whom he imagines as a kind of boat-woman escorting pedestrians across the River Styx, a friendâs unabashed use of air quotes, pickup basketball games, the silent nod of acknowledgment between black people. And more than any other subject, Gay celebrates the beauty of the natural worldâhis garden, the flowers in the sidewalk, the birds, the bees, the mushrooms, the trees.

This is not a book of how-to or inspiration, though it could be read that way. Fans of Roxane Gay, Maggie Nelson, and Kiese Laymon will revel in Gayâs voice, and his insights. The Book of Delights is about our connection to the world, to each other, and the rewards that come from a life closely observed. Gayâs pieces serve as a powerful and necessary reminder that we can, and should, stake out a space in our lives for delight.Â",writing

When Silas Heap unSeals a forgotten room in the Palace, he releases the ghost of a Queen who lived five hundred years earlier. Queen Etheldredda is as awful in death as she was in life, and she's still up to no good. Her diabolical plan to give herself everlasting life requires Jenna's compliance, Septimus's disappearance, and the talents of her son, Marcellus Pye, a famous Alchemist and Physician. And if Queen Etheldredda's plot involves Jenna and Septimus, then it will surely involve Nicko, Alther Mella, Marcia Overstrand, Beetle, Stanley, Sarah, Silas, Spit Fyre, Aunt Zelda, and all of the other wacky, wonderful characters that made Magyk and Flyte so memorable.

King Henry VIII of Englandâwho was not born to be king but embraced the role with gustoâbroke with the Roman Catholic Church, and made himself head of the Church of England.

Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, the most powerful man in the civilized world, obsessed with the religious disputes of Europe, was leader of the Spanish and then Roman Empire.

Suleiman the Magnificent, the richest of them all, stands apart as a Muslim, who brought the Ottoman Empire to its apogee of political, military, and economic power, as well as to the golden age of its artistic and architectural prowess.

Never before had humankind seen such giants coexisting. Against the rich background of the Renaissance, they laid the foundation for modern Europe.

Wills goes far beyond the recent revisionist debate over Jefferson's own slaves and his relationship with Sally Heming to look at the political relationship between the president and slavery. Jefferson won the election of 1800 with Electoral College votes derived from the three-fifths representation of slaves, who could not vote but who were partially counted as citizens. That count was known as ""the slave power"" granted to southern states, and it made some Federalists call Jefferson the Negro President -- one elected only by the slave count's margin.

Probing the heart of Jefferson's presidency, Wills reveals how the might of the slave states was a concern behind Jefferson's most important decisions and policies, including his strategy to expand the nation west. But the president met with resistance: Timothy Pickering, now largely forgotten, was elected to Congress to wage a fight against Jefferson and the institutions that supported him. Wills restores Pickering and his allies' dramatic struggle to our understanding of Jefferson and the creation of the new nation.

November 1958: the National Horse Show at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Into the rarefied atmosphere of wealth and tradition comes the most unlikely of horsesâa drab white former plow horse named Snowmanâand his rider, Harry de Leyer. They were the longest of all longshotsâand their win was the stuff of legend.
Â
Harry de Leyer first saw the horse he would name Snowman on a bleak winter afternoon between the slats of a rickety truck bound for the slaughterhouse. He recognized the spark in the eye of the beaten-up horse and bought him for eighty dollars. On Harryâs modest farm on Long Island, the horse thrived. But the recent Dutch immigrant and his growing family needed money, and Harry was always on the lookout for the perfect thoroughbred to train for the show-jumping circuitâso he reluctantly sold Snowman to a farm a few miles down the road.

But Snowman had other ideas about what Harry needed. When he turned up back at Harryâs barn, dragging an old tire and a broken fence board, Harry knew that he had misjudged the horse. And so he set about teaching this shaggy, easygoing horse how to fly. One show at a time, against extraordinary odds and some of the most expensive thoroughbreds alive, the pair climbed to the very top of the sport of show jumping.

56,"The Last Mughal: The Fall of a Dynasty: Delhi, 1857",William Dalrymple,4.17,"7,103",602,613,3,"On a hazy November afternoon in Rangoon, 1862, a shrouded corpse was escorted by a small group of British soldiers to an anonymous grave in a prison enclosure. As the British Commissioner in charge insisted, âNo vestige will remain to distinguish where the last of the Great Moghuls rests.â

Bahadur Shah Zafar II, the last Mughal Emperor, was a mystic, an accomplished poet a On a hazy November afternoon in Rangoon, 1862, a shrouded corpse was escorted by a small group of British soldiers to an anonymous grave in a prison enclosure. As the British Commissioner in charge insisted, âNo vestige will remain to distinguish where the last of the Great Moghuls rests.â

Bahadur Shah Zafar II, the last Mughal Emperor, was a mystic, an accomplished poet and a skilled calligrapher. But while his Mughal ancestors had controlled most of India, the aged Zafar was king in name only. Deprived of real political power by the East India Company, he nevertheless succeeded in creating a court of great brilliance, and presided over one of the great cultural renaissances of Indian history.

Then, in 1857, Zafar gave his blessing to a rebellion among the Companyâs own Indian troops, thereby transforming an army mutiny into the largest uprising any empire had to face in the entire course of the nineteenth century. The Siege of Delhi was the Rajâs Stalingrad: one of theÂ most horrific events in the history of Empire, in which thousands on both sides died. And when the British took the cityâsecuring their hold on the subcontinent for the next ninety yearsâtens of thousands more Indians were executed, including allÂ but twoÂ of Zafarâs sixteen sons. By the end of the four-month siege, Delhi was reduced to a battered, empty ruin, and Zafar was sentenced to exile in Burma. There he died, the last Mughal ruler in a line that stretched back to the sixteenth century.

Award-winning historian and travel writer William Dalrymple shapes his powerful retelling of this fateful course of events from groundbreaking material: previously unexamined Urdu and Persian manuscripts that include Indian eyewitness accounts and records of the Delhi courts, police and administration during the siege. The Last Mughal is a revelatory workâthe first to present the Indian perspective on the fall of Delhiâand has as its heart both the dazzling capital personified by Zafar and the stories of the individuals tragically caught up in one of the bloodiest upheavals in history.",history

Abilene Tucker feels abandoned. Her father has put her on a train, sending her off to live with an old friend for the summer while he works a railroad job. Armed only with a few possessions and her list of universals, Abilene jumps off the train in Manifest, Kansas, aiming to learn about the boy her father once was.

Having heard stories about Manifest, Abilene is disappointed to find that itâs just a dried-up, worn-out old town. But her disappointment quickly turns to excitement when she discovers a hidden cigar box full of mementos, including some old letters that mention a spy known as the Rattler.

The s ""Why is there a world rather than nothing at all?"" remains the darkest and most enduring of all metaphysical mysteries. Following in the footsteps of Christopher Hitchens, Roger Penrose, and even Stephen Hawking, Jim Holt now enters this fractious debate with his lively and deeply informed narrative that traces the latest efforts to grasp the origins of the universe. The slyly humorous Holt takes on the role of cosmological detective, suggesting that we might have been too narrow in limiting our suspects to Yahweh vs. the Big Bang. Tracking down an eccentric Oxford philosopher, a Physics Nobel Laureate, a French Buddhist monk who lived with the Dalai Lama, and John Updike just before he died, Holt pursues unexplored angles to this cosmic puzzle. As he pieces together a solution--one that sheds new light on the question of God and the meaning of existence--he offers brisk philosophical asides on time and eternity, consciousness, and the arithmetic of nothingness.

âThe pleasure of this book is watching the match: the staggeringly inventive human mind slamming its fantastic conjectures over the net, the universe coolly returning every serve.... Holt traffics in wonder, a word whose dual meaningsâthe absence of answers; the experience of aweâstrike me as profoundly related. His book is not utilitarian. You canât profit from it, at least not in the narrow sense.... And yet it does what real science writing should: It helps us feel the fullness of the problem.â (Kathryn Schulz, New York Magazine)

In 2003, Osama al-Kharrat returns to Beirut after many years in America to stand vigil at his fatherâs deathbed. The city is a shell of the Beirut Osama remembers, but he and his friends and family take solace in the things that have always sustained them: gossip, laughter, and, above all, stories.

More than that, weâre going to die together, as a united race facing a common enemy. Nationality no longer matters. Ancient grudges are forgotten. The human race must resist as one, or face extinction. And now it falls to me, along with Kainda, Em, Mira, Kat, Merrill, Aimee and Luca, to light the path for humanity in our darkest hour. Harnessing the power of the ancient Jericho shofar, we must prevent Nephil, the most ancient and evil of the Nephilim from possessing my body and using its supernatural abilities against mankind.

The odds are stacked against victory. The Nephilim out-size, out-power and outnumber us ten to one, but we will fight to the last, the very last, so help me God.

I am Solomon Ull Vincentâthe Last Hunter and King of Antarktosâand I am prepared to face my fate.

The Antarktos Saga is now complete! Pick up all 5 books together and enjoy this epic series front to back without pause. The books, in order, are:

The precocious chemist with a passion for poisons uncovers a fresh slew of misdeeds in the hamlet of Bishop's Lacey--mysteries involving a missing tot, a fortune-teller, and a corpse in Flavia's own backyard.

Flavia had asked the old Gypsy woman to tell her fortune, but never expected to stumble across the poor soul, bludgeoned in the wee hours in her own caravan. Was this an act of retribution by those convinced that the soothsayer had abducted a local child years ago? Certainly Flavia understands the bliss of settling scores; revenge is a delightful pastime when one has two odious older sisters. But how could this crime be connected to the missing baby? Had it something to do with the weird sect who met at the river to practice their secret rites? While still pondering the possibilities, Flavia stumbles upon another corpse--that of a notorious layabout who had been caught prowling about the de Luce's drawing room.

Pedaling Gladys, her faithful bicycle, across the countryside in search of clues to both crimes, Flavia uncovers some odd new twists. Most intriguing is her introduction to an elegant artist with a very special object in her possession--a portrait that sheds light on the biggest mystery of all: Who is Flavia?

The young life of Daoud Hariâhis friends call him Davidâhas been one of bravery and mesmerizing adventure. He is a living witness to the brutal genocide under way in Darfur.

The Translator is a suspenseful, harrowing, and deeply moving memoir of how one person has made a difference in the worldâan on-the-ground account of one of the biggest stories of our time. Using his high school knowledge of languages as his weaponâwhile others around him were taking up armsâDaoud Hari has helped inform the world about Darfur.

Hari, a Zaghawa tribesman, grew up in a village in the Darfur region of Sudan. As a child he saw colorful weddings, raced his camels across the desert, and played games in the moonlight after his work was done. In 2003, this traditional life was shattered when helicopter gunships appeared over Darfurâs villages, followed by Sudanese-government-backed militia groups attacking on horseback, raping and murdering citizens and burning villages. Ancient hatreds and greed for natural resources had collided, and the conflagration spread.

Though Hariâs village was attacked and destroyedhis family decimated and dispersed, he himself escaped. Roaming the battlefield deserts on camels, he and a group of his friends helped survivors find food, water, and the way to safety. When international aid groups and reporters arrived, Hari offered his services as a translator and guide. In doing so, he risked his life again and again, for the government of Sudan had outlawed journalists in the region, and death was the punishment for those who aided the âforeign spies.â And then, inevitably, his luck ran out and he was captured. . . .

The Translator tells the remarkable story of a man who came face-to-face with genocideâ time and again risking his own life to fight injustice and save his people.

If one basic principle has served as the bedrock of bestselling author Rutger Bregman's thinking, it is that every progressive idea -- whether it was the abolition of slavery, the advent of democracy, women's suffrage, or the ratification of marriage equality -- was once considered radical and dangerous by the mainstream opinion of its time. With Humankind, he brings that mentality to bear against one of our most entrenched ideas: namely, that human beings are by nature selfish and self-interested.

By providing a new historical perspective of the last 200,000 years of human history, Bregman sets out to prove that we are in fact evolutionarily wired for cooperation rather than competition, and that our instinct to trust each other has a firm evolutionary basis going back to the beginning of Homo sapiens. Bregman systematically debunks our understanding of the Milgram electrical-shock experiment, the Zimbardo prison experiment, and the Kitty Genovese ""bystander effect.""

In place of these, he offers little-known true stories: the tale of twin brothers on opposing sides of apartheid in South Africa who came together with Nelson Mandela to create peace; a group of six shipwrecked children who survived for a year and a half on a deserted island by working together; a study done after World War II that found that as few as 15% of American soldiers were actually capable of firing at the enemy.

The ultimate goal of Humankind is to demonstrate that while neither capitalism nor communism has on its own been proven to be a workable social system, there is a third option: giving ""citizens and professionals the means (left) to make their own choices (right)."" Reorienting our thinking toward positive and high expectations of our fellow man, Bregman argues, will reap lasting success.

Lam has spent years researching the Cascadia Subduction Zone. He published a theory that the unrelieved tectonic strain beneath the idyllic landscape of Cascadia Island could be triggered with modern construction processes â with catastrophic results. The paper was disregarded, even ridiculed, by his peers and by mega wealthy developer Mick Walker, who stands to earn millions from the construction of a luxury resort on Cascadia. The elegant casino, hotel, and convention center will reap millions for him even if the tiny island only lasts for a short timeâ¦
When a series of earthquakes begins to shake the Northwest Corridor, Dougâs worst fears are confirmed. In an attempt to convince Walker to evacuate Cascadia immediately, Doug hurries to join guests arriving for the resortâs grand opening. As the tremors wreak havoc across the Northwest coastal area, the military is left with too few resources to assist the people on Cascadia. Convinced that the island will be in ruins within hours, Doug reluctantly calls upon his girlfriend, Jennifer Lindstrom, president of Nightingale Aviation â a major medical transport helicopter company â for help.
With snow falling, visibility dropping, and winds increasing, Doug embarks on an impossible mission with Jennifer and Nightingaleâs helicopters to evacuate over three hundred people, while smaller earthquakes continue to herald the approach of a catastrophic tsunami.
John J. Nance hurtles readers along a nail-biting quest to rescue hundreds of stranded vacationers and resort staff. Meticulously researched, and with the signature authenticity only a veteran pilot could provide, Saving Cascadia is a hair-raising thriller of awesome magnitude.",fiction

Elwood Curtis has taken the words of Dr Martin Luther King to heart: he is as good as anyone. Abandoned by his parents, brought up by his loving, strict and clear-sighted grandmother, Elwood is about to enroll in the local black college. But given the time and the place, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy his future, and so Elwood arrives at The Nickel Academy, which claims to provide 'physical, intellectual and moral training' which will equip its inmates to become 'honorable and honest men'.

In reality, the Nickel Academy is a chamber of horrors, where physical, emotional and sexual abuse is rife, where corrupt officials and tradesmen do a brisk trade in supplies intended for the school, and where any boy who resists is likely to disappear 'out back'. Stunned to find himself in this vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold on to Dr King's ringing assertion, 'Throw us in jail, and we will still love you.' But Elwood's fellow inmate and new friend Turner thinks Elwood is naive and worse; the world is crooked, and the only way to survive is to emulate the cruelty and cynicism of their oppressors.

The tension between Elwood's idealism and Turner's skepticism leads to a decision which will have decades-long repercussions.

Based on the history of a real reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped and destroyed the lives of thousands of children, The Nickel Boys is a devastating, driven narrative by a great American novelist whose work is essential to understanding the current reality of the United States.",fiction

Frank Bruni was born round. Round as in stout, chubby, and hungry, always and endlessly hungry. He grew up in a big, loud Italian family in White Plains, New York, where meals were epic, outsize affairs. At those meals, he demonstrated one of his foremost qualifications for his future career: an epic, outsize appetite for food. But his relationship with eating was tricky, and his difficulties with managing it began early.

When he was named the restaurant critic for the New York Times in 2004, he knew enough to be nervous. He would be performing one of the most closely watched tasks in the epicurean universe; a bumpy ride was inevitable, especially for someone whose writing beforehand had focused on politics, presidential campaigns, and the Pope.

But as he tackled his new role as one of the most loved and hated tastemakers in the New York restaurant world, he also had to make sense of a decades-long love-hate affair with food, which had been his enemy as well as his friend. Now heâd have to face down this enemy at meal after indulgent meal. His Italian grandmother had often said, ""Born round, you donât die square."" Would he fall back into his worst old habits? Or had he established a truce with the food on his plate?

In tracing the highly unusual path Bruni traveled to become a restaurant critic, Born Round tells the captivating story of an unpredictable journalistic odyssey and provides an unflinching account of one personâs tumultuous, often painful lifelong struggle with his weight. How does a committed eater embrace food without being undone by it? Born Round will speak to every hungry hedonist who has ever had to rein in an appetite to avoid letting out a waistband, and it will delight anyone interested in matters of family, matters of the heart, and the big role food plays in both.",autobiography

At West Point Academy in 1830, the calm of an October evening is shattered by the discovery of a young cadet's body swinging from a rope just off the parade grounds. An apparent suicide is not unheard of in a harsh regimen like West Point's, but the next morning, an even greater horror comes to light. Someone has stolen into the room where the body lay and removed the heart.

At a loss for answers and desperate to avoid any negative publicity, the Academy calls on the services of a local civilian, Augustus Landor, a former police detective who acquired some renown during his years in New York City before retiring to the Hudson Highlands for his health. Now a widower, and restless in his seclusion, Landor agrees to take on the case. As he questions the dead man's acquaintances, he finds an eager assistant in a moody, intriguing young cadet with a penchant for drink, two volumes of poetry to his name, and a murky past that changes from telling to telling. The cadet's name? Edgar Allan Poe.

Impressed with Poe's astute powers of observation, Landor is convinced that the poet may prove usefulâif he can stay sober long enough to put his keen reasoning skills to the task. Working in close contact, the two menâseparated by years but alike in intelligenceâdevelop a surprisingly deep rapport as their investigation takes them into a hidden world of secret societies, ritual sacrifices, and more bodies. Soon, however, the macabre murders and Landor's own buried secrets threaten to tear the two men and their newly formed friendship apart.

In Underland, he delivers his masterpiece: an epic exploration of the Earthâs underworlds as they exist in myth, literature, memory, and the land itself.

In this highly anticipated sequel to his international bestseller The Old Ways, Macfarlane takes us on an extraordinary journey into our relationship with darkness, burial, and what lies beneath the surface of both place and mind. Traveling through âdeep timeââthe dizzying expanses of geologic time that stretch away from the presentâhe moves from the birth of the universe to a post-human future, from the prehistoric art of Norwegian sea caves to the blue depths of the Greenland ice cap, from Bronze Age funeral chambers to the catacomb labyrinth below Paris, and from the underground fungal networks through which trees communicate to a deep-sunk âhiding placeâ where nuclear waste will be stored for 100,000 years to come. Woven through Macfarlaneâs own travels are the unforgettable stories of descents into the underland made across history by explorers, artists, cavers, divers, mourners, dreamers, and murderers, all of whom have been drawn for different reasons to seek what Cormac McCarthy calls âthe awful darkness within the world.â

Global in its geography and written with great lyricism and power, Underland speaks powerfully to our present moment. Taking a deep-time view of our planet, Macfarlane here asks a vital and unsettling question: âAre we being good ancestors to the future Earth?â Underland marks a new turn in Macfarlaneâs long-term mapping of the relations of landscape and the human heart.

This key sends Julie on a journey that will change her life foreverâa journey into the troubled past of her ancestor Giulietta Tolomei. In 1340, still reeling from the slaughter of her parents, Giulietta was smuggled into Siena, where she met a young man named Romeo. Their ill-fated love turned medieval Siena upside-down and went on to inspire generations of poets and artists, the story reaching its pinnacle in Shakespeareâs famous tragedy.

But six centuries have a way of catching up to the present, and Julie gradually begins to discover that here, in this ancient city, the past and present are hard to tell apart. The deeper she delves into the history of Romeo and Giulietta, and the closer she gets to the treasure they allegedly left behind, the greater the danger surrounding herâsuperstitions, ancient hostilities, and personal vendettas.

Then a reality TV show featuring the missing apes debuts under mysterious circumstances, and it immediately becomes the biggest - and unlikeliest - phenomenon in the history of modern media. Millions of fans are glued to their screens watching the apes order greasy take-out, have generous amounts of sex, and sign for Isabel to come get them. Now, to save her family of apes from this parody of human life, Isabel must connect with her own kind, including John; a green-haired vegan; and a retired porn star with her own agenda.

Ape House delivers great entertainment, but it also opens the animal world to us in ways few novels have done, securing Sara Gruenâs place as a master storyteller who allows us to see ourselves as we never have before.",fiction

Her life would still be perfect â with only the tiny cracks of an angry junkie for a brother and a charming drunk with shady underworld connections for an uncle to mar the otherwise flawless whole.

In the early 1980s, a Houston socialite turned the attention of maverick Texas congressman Charlie Wilson to the ragged band of Afghan ""freedom fighters"" who continued, despite overwhelming odds, to fight the Soviet invaders. Wilson, who sat on the all-powerful House Appropriations Committee, managed to procure hundreds of millions of dollars to support the mujahideen. The arms were secretly procured and distributed with the help of an out-of-favor CIA operative, Gust Avrokotos, whose working-class Greek-American background made him an anomaly among the Ivy League world of American spies.

At first, Alaska seems to be the answer to their prayers. In a wild, remote corner of the state, they find a fiercely independent community of strong men and even stronger women.

January 12, 1888, began as an unseasonably warm morning across Nebraska, the Dakotas, and Minnesota A masterful portrait of a tragic crucible in the settlement of the American heartland - the 'Children's Blizzard' of 1888.

The gripping story of an epic prairie snowstorm that killed hundreds of newly arrived settlers and cast a shadow on the promise of the American frontier.

January 12, 1888, began as an unseasonably warm morning across Nebraska, the Dakotas, and Minnesota, the weather so mild that children walked to school without coats and gloves. But that afternoon, without warning, the atmosphere suddenly, violently changed. One moment the air was calm; the next the sky exploded in a raging chaos of horizontal snow and hurricane-force winds. Temperatures plunged as an unprecedented cold front ripped through the center of the continent.

By Friday morning, January 13, some five hundred people lay dead on the drifted prairie, many of them children who had perished on their way home from country schools. In a few terrifying hours, the hopes of the pioneers had been blasted by the bitter realities of their harsh environment. Recent immigrants from Germany, Norway, Denmark, and the Ukraine learned that their free homestead was not a paradise but a hard, unforgiving place governed by natural forces they neither understood nor controlled.

With the storm as its dramatic, heartbreaking focal point, The Children's Blizzard captures this pivotal moment in American history by tracing the stories of five families who were forever changed that day. Drawing on family interviews and memoirs, as well as hundreds of contemporary accounts, David Laskin creates an intimate picture of the men, women, and children who made choices they would regret as long as they lived. Here too is a meticulous account of the evolution of the storm and the vain struggle of government forecasters to track its progress.

The blizzard of January 12, 1888, is still remembered on the prairie. Children fled that day while their teachers screamed into the relentless roar. Husbands staggered into the blinding wind in search of wives. Fathers collapsed while trying to drag their children to safety. In telling the story of this meteorological catastrophe, the deadliest blizzard ever to hit the prairie states, David Laskin has produced a masterful portrait of a tragic crucible in the settlement of the American heartland.",history

Frank Baum's intrepid wife, Maud--from the family's hardscrabble days in South Dakota to the Hollywood film set where she first meets Judy Garland.

Maud Gage Baum, widow of the author of the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, met Judy Garland, the young actress playing the role of Dorothy on the set of The Wizard of Oz in 1939. At the time, Maud was seventy-eight and Judy was sixteen. In spite of their age difference, Maud immediately connected to Judy--especially when Maud heard her sing ""Over the Rainbow,"" a song whose yearning brought to mind the tough years in South Dakota when Maud and her husband struggled to make a living--until Frank Baum's book became a national sensation.

This wonderfully evocative two-stranded story recreates Maud's youth as the rebellious daughter of a leading suffragette, and the prairie years of Maud and Frank's early days when they lived among the people--especially young Dorothy--who would inspire Frank's masterpiece. Woven into this past story is one set in 1939, describing the high-pressured days on The Wizard of Oz film set where Judy is being badgered by the director, producer, and her ambitious stage mother to lose weight, bind her breasts, and laugh, cry, and act terrified on command. As Maud had promised to protect the original Dorothy back in Aberdeen, she now takes on the job of protecting young Judy.",historical

scientists are excavating the most extraordinary undersea discovery ever made. But is it the greatest archaeological find in historyâor the most terrifying?

Former naval doctor Peter Crane is urgently summoned to a remote oil platform in the North Atlantic to help diagnose a bizarre medical condition spreading through the rig. But when he arrives, Crane learns that the real trouble lies far belowâon âDeep Storm,â a stunningly advanced science research facility built two miles beneath the surface on the ocean floor. The top secret structure has been designed for one purpose: to excavate a recently discovered undersea site that may hold the answers to a mystery steeped in centuries of myth and speculation.

Sworn to secrecy, Dr. Crane descends to Deep Storm. A year earlier, he is told, routine drilling uncovered the remains of mankindâs most sophisticated ancient civilization: the legendary Atlantis. But now that the site is being excavated, a series of disturbing illnesses has begun to affect the operation. Scientists and technicians are experiencing a bizarre array of symptomsâfrom simple fatigue to violent psychotic episodes. As Crane is indoctrinated into the strange world of Deep Storm and commences his investigation, he begins to suspect that the covert facility conceals something more complicated than a medical mystery.The discovery of Atlantis might, in fact, be a cover for something far more sinister . . . and deadly.

Like Lincoln Childâs spectacular bestsellers coauthored with Douglas Preston (The Book of the Dead, Relic), Deep Storm melds scientific detail and gripping adventure in a superbly imagined, chillingly real journey into unknown territory.

Her palace shimmered with onyx, garnets, and gold, but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator.

Though her life spanned fewer than forty years, The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer brings to life the most intriguing woman in the history of the world: Cleopatra, the last queen of Egypt.

Her palace shimmered with onyx, garnets, and gold, but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator.

Though her life spanned fewer than forty years, it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice, each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar andâafter his murderâthree more with his protÃ©gÃ©. Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire, in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since.

Famous long before she was notorious, Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo, Tiepolo, and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way, Cleopatraâs supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost. In a masterly return to the classical sources, Stacy Schiff here boldly separates fact from fiction to rescue the magnetic queen whose death ushered in a new world order. Rich in detail, epic in scope, Schiff âs is a luminous, deeply original reconstruction of a dazzling life.",history

Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar.
On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family-and his adoptive brother-will be the most powerful force in his life.
As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat-under the tutelage of one of Rome's most fearsome gladiators-Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier's proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win.
The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict-a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test.
Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts-from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin. Superbly rendered, grippingly told, Emperor, The Gates of Rome is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new voice in historical fiction. ""From the Hardcover edition.""",historical

Scotland, 1863.

Bessy lacks the necessary scullery skills for her new position, but as she finds out, it is her ability to read and write that makes her such a desirable property. Bessy is intrigued by her new employer but puzzled by her increasingly strange requests and her insistence that Bessy keep a journal of her mundane chores and most intimate thoughts. And it seems that the missus has a few secrets of her own, including her near- obsessive affection for Nora, a former maid who died in mysterious circumstances.

Giving in to her curiosity, Bessy makes an infuriating discovery and, out of jealousy, concocts a childish prank that backfires and threatens to jeopardize all that she has come to hold dear. Yet even when caught up in a tangle of madness, ghosts, sex, and lies, she remains devoted to Arabella. But who is really responsible for what happened to her predecessor Nora? As her past threatens to catch up with her and raise the stakes even further, Bessy begins to realize that she has not quite landed on her feet.

The Observations is a brilliantly original, endlessly intriguing story of one womanâs journey from a difficult past into an even more disturbing present, narrated by one of the most vividly imagined heroines in recent fiction. This powerful story of secrets and suspicions, hidden histories and mysterious disappearances is at once compelling and heart-warming, showing the redemptive power of loyalty and friendship.

But it's the personal battles of Folly Beach's residents that have left the most scars, and why a young widow has been beckoned there to heal her own...

To most people, Folly Beach is simply the last barrier island before reaching the great Atlantic. To some, it's a sanctuary for lost souls, which is why Emmy Hamilton's mother encourages her to buy the local book store, Folly's Finds, hoping it will distract Emmy from the loss of her husband.

Emmy is at first resistant. So much has already changed. But after finding love letters and an image of a beautiful bottle tree in a box of used books from Folly's Finds, she decides to take the plunge. But the seller insists on one condition: Emmy must allow Lulu, the late owner's difficult sister, to continue selling her bottle trees from its back yard.

For the most part Emmy ignores Lulu as she sifts through the love letters, wanting to learn more. But the more she discovers about the letters, the more she understands Lulu. As details of a possible murder and a mysterious disappearance during WWII are revealed, the two women discover that circumstances beyond their control, sixty years apart, have brought them together, here on Folly Beach.

248,Colonel Roosevelt,Edmund Morris,4.01,"22,302",653,766,0,"Of all our great presidents, Theodore Roosevelt is the only one whose greatness increased out of office. When he toured Europe in 1910 as plain âColonel Roosevelt,â he was hailed as the most famous man in the world. Crowned heads vied to put him up in their palaces. âIf I see another king,â he joked, âI think I shall bite him.â

Had TR won his historic âBull Mooseâ campaign Of all our great presidents, Theodore Roosevelt is the only one whose greatness increased out of office. When he toured Europe in 1910 as plain âColonel Roosevelt,â he was hailed as the most famous man in the world. Crowned heads vied to put him up in their palaces. âIf I see another king,â he joked, âI think I shall bite him.â

Had TR won his historic âBull Mooseâ campaign in 1912 (when he outpolled the sitting president, William Howard Taft), he might have averted World War I, so great was his international influence. Had he not died in 1919, at the early age of sixty, he would unquestionably have been reelected to a third term in the White House and completed the work he began in 1901 of establishing the United States as a model democracy, militarily strong and socially just.

This biography by Edmund Morris, the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Awardâwinning author of The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Rex, is itself the completion of a trilogy sure to stand as definitive. Packed with more adventure, variety, drama, humor, and tragedy than a big novel, yet documented down to the smallest fact, it recounts the last decade of perhaps the most amazing life in American history. What other president has written forty books, hunted lions, founded a third political party, survived an assassinâs bullet, and explored an unknown river longer than the Rhine?

Colonel Roosevelt begins with a prologue recounting what TR called his âjourney into the Pleistoceneââa yearlong safari through East Africa, collecting specimens for the Smithsonian. Some readers will be repulsed by TRâs bloodlust, which this book does not prettify, yet there can be no denying that the Colonel passionately loved and understood every living thing that came his way: The text is rich in quotations from his marvelous nature writing.

Although TR intended to remain out of politics when he returned home in 1910, a fateful decision that spring drew him back into public life. By the end of the summer, in his famous âNew Nationalismâ speech, he was the guiding spirit of the Progressive movement, which inspired much of the social agenda of the future New Deal. (TRâs fifth cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt acknowledged that debt, adding that the Colonel âwas the greatest man I ever knew.â)

Then follows a detailed account of TRâs reluctant yet almost successful campaign for the White House in 1912. But unlike other biographers, Edmund Morris does not treat TR mainly as a politician. This volume gives as much consideration to TRâs literary achievements and epic expedition to Brazil in 1913â1914 as to his fatherhood of six astonishingly different children, his spiritual and aesthetic beliefs, and his eager embrace of other culturesâfrom Arab and Magyar to German and American Indian. It is impossible to read Colonel Roosevelt and not be awed by the manâs universality. The Colonel himself remarked, âI have enjoyed life as much as any nine men I know.â

Morris does not hesitate, however, to show how pathologically TR turned upon those who inherited the power he cravedâthe hapless Taft, the adroit Woodrow Wilson. When Wilson declined to bring the United States into World War I in 1915 and 1916, the Colonel blasted him with some of the worst abuse ever uttered by a former chief executive. Yet even Wilson had to admit that behind the Rooseveltian will to rule lay a winning idealism and decency. âHe is just like a big boyâthere is a sweetness about him that you canât resist.â That makes the story of TRâs last year, when the âboyâ in him died, all the sadder in the telling: the conclusion of a life of Aristotelian grandeur.",biography

Hoe kon de vroegere, relatief rustige kolonie van BelgiÃ«, sinds 1960 onafhankelijk, zo veranderen? David Van Reybrouck beschrijft voor het eerst de verbijsterende geschiedenis van Congo, van ruim voor de komst van de ontdekkingsreiziger Stanley tot en met de invloed van China in de laatste tien jaar en de recente economische crisis. Van 1885 tot 1908 werd het land bestierd door koning Leopold ii, die een fortuin verdiende met de exploitatie van rubber.

De kolonisatie door BelgiÃ« in de periode van 1908 tot 1960 zorgde voor industrialisatie en infrastructuur, maar werd ook gekenmerkt door paternalisme, zo niet betutteling. De onverhoedse overgang van kolonie naar onafhankelijke staat rond 1960 is een adembenemend verhaal vol idealisme en gekonkel. Het nieuwe land stortte zich in een turbulent avontuur dat steeds wilder en chaotischer werd en na tweeÃ«ndertig jaar dictatuur onder Mobutu leidde tot een van de dodelijkste conflicten sinds de Tweede Wereldoorlog. Van Reybrouck baseert zich niet alleen op zeldzaam archiefmateriaal en baanbrekend onderzoek, maar vooral ook op honderden gesprekken die hij met Congolezen voerde.

An inspiring tale of a fourth-grader who fights back when her favorite book is banned from the school library--by starting her own illegal locker library!

It all started the day Amy Anne Ollinger tried to check out her favorite book in the whole world, From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, from the school library. That's when Mrs. Jones, the librarian, told her the bad news: her favorite book was banned! All because a classmate's mom thought the book wasn't appropriate for kids to read.

Amy Anne decides to fight back by starting a secret banned books library out of her locker. Soon, she finds herself on the front line of an unexpected battle over book banning, censorship, and who has the right to decide what she and her fellow students can read.

Reminiscent of the classic novel Frindle by Andrew Clements for its inspiring message, Ban This Book is a love letter to the written word and its power to give kids a voice.

The story of Lance Armstrongâthe cyclist who recovered from testicular cancer a From award-winning journalist David Walsh, the definitive account of the authorâs twelve-year quest to uncover and make known the truth about Lance Armstrongâs long history of performance-enhancing drug use, which ultimately led to the cyclistâs being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles.

The story of Lance Armstrongâthe cyclist who recovered from testicular cancer and went on to win the Tour de France a record seven times, the man who wrote a bestselling and inspirational account of his life, the charitable benefactorâseemed almost too good to be true. And it was.

As early as Armstrongâs first victory on the Tour in 1999, The Sunday Times (London) journalist David Walsh had reason to think that the incredible performances we were seeing from Armstrong were literally too good to be true. Based on insider information and dogged research, he began to unmask the truth. Cyclingâs biggest star used every weapon in his armory to protect his name.

But he could not keep everyone silent.

In the autumn of 2012, the US Anti-Doping Agency published a damning report on Armstrong that resulted in the American being stripped of his seven Tour victories and left his reputation in shreds. Walshâs long fight to reveal the truth had been vindicated. This book tells the compelling story of one manâs struggle to bring that truth to light against all the odds.",non-fiction

Then a stunning opportunity presents itself, in the person of a hero called the Godslayer and a band of legendary warriors, and he has to seize his chance or lose his dream forever.

What happened in Weep two hundred years ago to cut it off from the rest of the world? What exactly did the Godslayer slay that went by the name of god? And what is the mysterious problem he now seeks help in solving?

The answers await in Weep, but so do more mysteriesâincluding the blue-skinned goddess who appears in Lazloâs dreams. How did he dream her before he knew she existed? And if all the gods are dead, why does she seem so real?

Not the bucolic Vermont back roads college sophomore Laurel Estabrook likes to bike. Not the savage assault she suffers toward the end of one of her rides. And certainly not Bobbie Crocker, the elderly man with a history of mental illness whom Laurel comes to know through her work at a Burlington homeless shelter in the years subsequent to the attack.

In his moments of lucidity, the gentle, likable Bobbie alludes to his earlier life as a successful photographer. Laurel finds it hard to believe that this destitute, unstable man could once have chronicled the lives of musicians and celebrities, but a box of photographs and negatives discovered among Bobbie's meager possessions after his death lends credence to his tale. How could such an accomplished man have fallen on such hard times? Becoming obsessed with uncovering Bobbie's past, Laurel studies his photographs, tracking down every lead they provide into the mystery of his life before homelessness -- including links to the rich neighborhoods of her own Long Island childhood and to the earlier world of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, with its larger-than-life characters, elusive desires, and haunting sorrows.

In a narrative of dazzling invention, literary ingenuity, and psychological complexity, Bohjalian engages issues of homelessness and mental illness by evoking the humanity that inhabits the core of both. At the same time, his tale is fast-paced and riveting -- The Double Bind combines the suspense of a thriller with the emotional depths of the most intimate drama. The breathtaking surprises of its final pages will leave readers stunned, overwhelmed by the poignancy of life's fleeting truths, as caught in Bobbie Crocker's photographs and in Laurel Estabrook's painful pursuit of Bobbie's past -- and her own.


Behind The Double Bind

While Bobbie Crocker, the photographer in The Double Bind, is fictitious, the photographs that appear in the book are real. They were taken by a man named Bob ""Soupy"" Campbell, who, as Chris Bohaljian explains in his Author's Note, ""had gone from photographing luminaries from the 1950s and 1960s to winding up at a homeless shelter in northern Vermont.""

Bohaljian's viewing of Campbell's work after the photographer's death provided an inspiration for The Double Bind. ""We tend to stigmatize the homeless and blame them for their plight,"" Bohjalian writes.

""We are oblivious to the fact that most had lives as serious as our own before everything fell apart. The photographs in this book are a testimony to that reality.""",fiction

Harold Silver has spent a lifetime watching his younger brother, George, a taller, smarter, and more successful high-flying TV executive, acquire a covetable wife, two kids, and a beautiful home in the suburbs of New York City. But Harry, a historian and Nixon scholar, also knows George has a murderous temper, and when George loses control the result is an act of violence so shocking that both brothers are hurled into entirely new lives in which they both must seek absolution.

Harry finds himself suddenly playing parent to his brotherâs two adolescent children, tumbling down the rabbit hole of Internet sex, dealing with aging parents who move through time like travelers on a fantastic voyage.

Season of the Witch is the first book to fully capture the dark magic of San Francisco in this breathtaking period, when the city radically changed itself & then revolutionized the world. The cool gray city of love was the epicenter of the 60s cultural revolution. But by the early 70s, San Franciscoâs ecstatic experiment came crashing down from its starry heights. The city was rocked by savage murder sprees, mysterious terror campaigns, political assassinations, street riots & finally a terrifying sexual epidemic. No other city endured so many calamities in such a short time span.

Talbot goes deep into the riveting story of his cityâs ascent, decline & heroic recovery. He draws intimate portraits of San Franciscoâs legendary demons & saviors: Charles Manson, Patty Hearst & the Symbionese Liberation Army, Jerry Garcia, Janis Joplin, Bill Graham, Herb Caen, the Cockettes, Harvey Milk, Jim Jones & the Peoples Temple, Joe Montana & the Super Bowl 49ers.

He reveals how the city emerged from the trials of this period with a new brand of âSan Francisco values,â including gay marriage, medical marijuana, immigration sanctuary, universal health care, recycling, renewable energy, consumer safety & a living wage mandate. Considered radical when they were first introduced, these ideas have become the bedrock of decent society in many parts of the country & exemplify the ways that the city now inspires a live-and-let-live tolerance, a shared sense of humanity & an openness to change.

As a new generation of activists & dreamers seeks its own path to a more enlightened future, Season of the Witchâwith its epic tale of the wild & bloody birth of San Francisco valuesâoffers both inspiration & cautionary wisdom.",history

The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more thanÂ forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.

The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.âs grandparents were âdirt poor and in love,â and moved north from Kentuckyâs Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that J.D.'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life,Â neverÂ fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.

Above the East China Sea tells the entwined stories of two teenaged girls, an American and an Okinawan, whose lives are connected across seventy years by the shared experience of profound loss, the enduring strength of an ancient culture, and the redeeming power of family love.

Luz James, a contemporary U.S. Air Force brat, lives with her strictly-by-the-rules sergeant mother at Kadena Air Base in Okianawa. Luzâs older sister, her best friend and emotional center, has just been killed in the Afghan war. Unmoored by her sisterâs death and a lifetime of constant moving from base to base, Luz turns for the comfort her service-hardened mother cannot offer to the âSmokinawans,â the âwaste cases,â who gather to get high every night in a deserted cove. When even pills, one-hitters, Cuervo Gold, and a growing crush on Jake Furusato arenât enough to soften the unbearable edge, the desolate girl contemplates taking her own life.

In 1945, Tamiko Kokuba, along with two hundred of her classmates, is plucked out of her elite girlsâ high school and trained to work in the Imperial Armyâs horrific cave hospitals. With defeat certain, Tamiko finds herself squeezed between the occupying Japanese and the invading Americans. She believes she has lost her entire family, as well as the island paradise she so loved, and, like Luz, she aches with a desire to be reunited with her beloved sister.

On an island where the spirits of the dead are part of life and your entire clan waits for you in the afterworld, suicide offers Tamiko the promise of peace. As Luz tracks down the story of her own Okinawan grandmother, she discovers that, if she surrenders to the most unbrat impulse and allows herself to connect completely with a place and its people, the ancestral spirits will save not only Tamiko but her as well.

Propelled by a riveting narrative and set at the very epicenter of the headline-grabbing clash now emerging between the great powers, Above the East China Sea is at once a remarkable chronicle of how war shapes the lives of conquerors as well as the conquered and a deeply moving account of family, friendship, and love that transcends time.",historical

In North America, his name still grac The acclaimed author of Founding Gardeners reveals the forgotten life of Alexander von Humboldt, the visionary German naturalist whose ideas changed the way we see the natural worldâand in the process created modern environmentalism.

Alexander von Humboldt (1769 â 1859) was an intrepid explorer and the most famous scientist of his age. In North America, his name still graces four counties, thirteen towns, a river, parks, bays, lakes, and mountains. His restless life was packed with adventure and discovery, whether he was climbing the highest volcanoes in the world or racing through anthrax-infected Siberia or translating his research into bestselling publications that changed science and thinking. Among Humboldt's most revolutionary ideas was a radical vision of nature, that it is a complex and interconnected global force that does not exist for the use of humankind alone.

Now Andrea Wulf brings the man and his achievements back into focus: his daring expeditions and investigation of wild environments around the world and his discoveries of similarities between climate and vegetation zones on different continents. She also discusses his prediction of human-induced climate change, his remarkable ability to fashion poetic narrative out of scientific observation, and his relationships with iconic figures such as SimÃ³n BolÃ­var and Thomas Jefferson. Wulf examines how Humboldt's writings inspired other naturalists and poets such as Darwin, Wordsworth, and Goethe, and she makes the compelling case that it was Humboldt's influence that led John Muir to his ideas of natural preservation and that shaped Thoreau's Walden.

With this brilliantly researched and compellingly written book, Andrea Wulf shows the myriad fundamental ways in which Humboldt created our understanding of the natural world, and she champions a renewed interest in this vital and lost player in environmental history and science.",non-fiction

k), schlÃ¤gt mit dem neuen Beitrag zur ""Policy of Pretention. Krisenkonferenzen und informelles Regierungssystem im Kaiserreich, 1905-1914"" den Bogen Ã¼ber 25 Jahre Weltkriegforschung.

Dass in diesem Zusammenhang dem Problem der Krisenkonferenzen
allgemein, und im November/Dezember 1912 im Besonderen, innerhalb des Entscheidungsprozesses der politischen und militÃ¤rischen FÃ¼hrungselite des Deutschen Reiches, entscheidende Bedeutung, im Hinblick auf einen Krieg in absehbarer Frist, zukommt, belegen die hier vorgelegten neuen Quellen. Die deutsche Historiker-Zunft mag es begrÃ¼Ãen oder nicht: es geht um den Entschluss des Kaiserreiches von 1912, den groÃen Krieg bei nÃ¤chster sich bietender Gelegenheit zu fÃ¼hren.

Dazu wird das Spektrum des innenpolitischen KrÃ¤ftespiels im Deutschen Reich von 1871, unter dem dezidiert entwickelten Blickwinkel des Einsatzes der Armee im Inneren (Staatsstreich-, Anarchismus-, Streik-, Revolutions- und BÃ¼rgerkriegsdrohung), aus der Sicht der MilitÃ¤rbehÃ¶rden schÃ¤rfer konturiert und damit der Weg in den Ersten Weltkrieg ergÃ¤nzend, unter dem Aspekt der Kriegsvorbereitung, beleuchtet. Die These der DÃ¼sseldorfer Schule, es sei auf Grund der inneren Strukturen des Reiches (informeller Regierungsstil Wilhelms II.) von einer ""Polykratie"", d. h. der vielfach behaupteten, jede Entscheidung paralysierenden ""ZerklÃ¼ftetheit der EntscheidungstrÃ¤ger"" in Berlin, auszugehen, dieser Theorie im Gefolge Gerhard Ritters, wird hier, mit dem Blick auf die Institution20der ""Krisenkonferenzen""(1875-1912) im Kaiserreich, der Boden entzogen. Wie dieser Begriff, durch Wolfgang Mommsen zunÃ¤chst adaptiert, die DÃ¼sseldorfer Argumentation zu Fall bringt, ist in dem abschlieÃenden Beitrag zur ""Policy of Pretention"" des
Reichs fÃ¼r die Jahre 1871 bis 1914 entwickelt.

Dass das Deutsche Reich im Kriege nicht den allseits erwarteten
militÃ¤rischen Erfolg erzielte, war u.a. in den tiefliegenden Defekten
des deutschen Staatswesens und dessen StreitkrÃ¤ften begrÃ¼ndet. Ein in
den gesellschaftlichen Strukturen erstarrtes Staatswesen hatte die
Zeichen der Zeit nicht erkannt. MittelmÃ¤Ãiges ""Management"", veranlasste u.a. im September 1914 FehlschlÃ¤ge (Marneschlacht) die irreparabel waren. Der Krieg, so wie er politisch und militÃ¤risch zuvor gedacht gewesen war, ging verloren. Ein vierjÃ¤hriges, verlustreiches und nutzloses Ringen folgte. Alle Beteiligten bÃ¼Ãten in der Folge ihre -

Indonesia â A Description
I started writing what would eventually form the basis of this novella over a decade ago. At first they were a loosely connected set of stories, poems, notes, or what the Australian writer Henry Lawson mightâve referred to as sketches. As time went by and my writing skills improved, I came to realise there was enough material to comprise a short novel, and gradually began drawing all the pieces together until they bonded into a recognisable whole.
The subsequent book follows my adventures as I wander from one Indonesian island to another without any recognisable itinerary or purpose. From volcanos at dawn to beach bars populated with philosophical gigolos, each chapter documents my own weirdie travel experience in the region. There are encounters with goddesses, man-eating komodo dragons, sex fiends, islands without beer, spirits of delight, tattooed prostitutes, drug-fuelled hallucinations, and even a little holiday romance Island of the Gods style. And of course alcohol, for like most of my work, a good deal of drinking occurs.
For those interested in chronology, the events described in Indonesia predate the fictionalised events described in my novel, Last Days of the Cross.

Back in the flaky-skinned early Nineties Mark Simpson predicted the future of men was metrosexual. Two decades on even he's shocked by what hussies today's males have become - and the shameless, fatal Jersey Shore that masculinity has washed up on.

Metrosexy collects Simpson's essays chronicling the emergence from his walk-in closet of man's desire to be desired. And just how terrifyingly insatiable it turned out to be. He takes a long look at men that long to be looked at, from metrosexual poster boy David Beckham to Daniel Craig's busty James Bond, and concludes that the masculine aesthetic revolution is only just beginning to get into its sashay.

""Contrary to what you've been told,"" says Simpson, ""metrosexuality is not about flip-flops and facials, 'man-bags' or 'manscara'. Or about men becoming 'girlie' or 'gay'. It's about men becoming everything. To themselves. In much the way that women have been for some time. It's the end of the sexual division of bathroom and bedroom labour. It's the end of sexuality as we've known it.""

More fun-packed than Beck's bulging briefs, The Situation's six-pack - or Ronaldo's ego - Metrosexy will leave you gasping and giggling and gagging for more.

PRAISE FOR SIMPSON AND METROSEXY:

âWildly intelligent and terrifyingly funny, his outlandish predictions on the fate of mankind have all proved unnervingly prescient. I dread to think what he might come up with next. Read him at your leisure but ignore him at your peril.â
â Jake Arnott, author of âThe Long Firmâ

""Much has been written about metrosexuals, but no one has done it as well as the man credited with coining the term, Mark Simpson.""
â The Times of India

âSimpson writes with enough panache to make most of his contemporaries toss their laptops in the waste-disposal and weep.â

One late October evening at an East Texas

tale of unspoken revenge, a harrowing quest,
and a terrible sword which everyone soon

in a long black box.

challenge the consequences of that blade's
peculiar edge, which from hilt to point never

on time and malice.

After the disappearance of Leon Owenby, his younger brother and central narrator, Martin, returns to the familyâs Willoby County, N.C., mountain town from his life as a destitute writer in New York City to aid in the search for Leon and support his other siblings. The year is 1986; Martin leaves behind his ex-lover, Dennis, and their many friends sick and dying from AIDS. Back home, he must face his painful past, his extended family to whom he is closeted, and his high school girlfriend (who still carries a torch for him). Many months of searching reveal more about the searchers than about Leon; the secrets and resentments in the Owenby family run deep and bubble to the surface unexpectedly.

Itâs problematic that with so many family issues coming to light, Martinâs sexuality is ignored and remains a secret, but Newtonâs use of multiple viewpoints and distinct voices is adept and lively, and helps to fill in the thin premise of Leonâs disappearance. With many novels of this construction, a reader tends to favor one voice over the rest. Not so here; Newton delivers across the board with these characters, who run the gamut from perky to depressive, desperate to schizophrenic.",fiction

Conductors in Conversation: The Complete Collection is an amalgamation of two books now out of print, Conversations with Conductors (1976) and Conductors in Conversation (1990), both published by Robson Books and described by one reviewer as ""a prime example of what any music book should offer"".
Author Robert Chesterman's interviews with conductors as celebrated as Leonard Bernstein, Claudio Abbado and Herbert von Karajan present fresh insights into their individual characters, their personal ideologies and their practical approaches - and in many cases, their private lives - as well as into classical music in general.
For this new edition, Chesterman has re-edited the entire contents, updated information on the conductors, added a further chapter on Rafael Kubelik, incorporated fascinating rare photographs and written a compelling new introduction. This resulting volume is an indispensible addition to the bookshelves of musicians, students, journalists, academics, lovers of classical music and any scholars who need to know something about 20th century music history.
There is captivating new biographical information on the conductors, their teachers and their mentors - all in the easily-readable form of conversational Q & A, which gives the reader a true sense of intimacy with these musical powerhouses while enlivening the sometimes-staid world of classical music journalism.",music

Does the current marriage contract need amending to keep it viable rather than remaining as an agreement that will inevitably be broken more than fifty percent of the time? These are the fundamental questions that are asked in the fast-paced, darkly comedic novelette enti Is the idea of a lifetime commitment inside the sacred institution of a marriage an antiquated notion? Does the current marriage contract need amending to keep it viable rather than remaining as an agreement that will inevitably be broken more than fifty percent of the time? These are the fundamental questions that are asked in the fast-paced, darkly comedic novelette entitled The Marriage Lease.


The topic of marriage consistently fills the headlines of today's newspapers debating who should be able to get married and who should not, all the while ignoring the enormous flaws in a social contract that is still regarded as the bond that holds society together. The story of The Marriage Lease has addressed these concerns with a nod to the absurd, though there is no doubt that some readers might find the notion of putting a cap on the timeline of a relationship appealing. Who can't commit to a six month pre-agreed upon relationship knowing it could be re-newed or rolled over into a much more attractive newer model?


Through the eyes of Nick, a lawyer who specializes in Contract Law and facing the reality of pending nuptials himself, the character confronts the issue of marriage in the modern age. However will this re-negotiating of the terms of marriage cost him everything or is he actually preserving the existence of the committed relationship? The deeper Nick delves into these disconcerting ideas, the more he realizes what is at stake has direct implications for the world at large.


At 52 pages the densely packed book will be read through fairly quickly, though the concepts will linger indefinitely inspiring debate, revulsion and discussion. Will this usher in a new enlightenment or hasten the death of romance?",NA

In ""The Wife of the Dictator,"" that eponymous wife (""brought back . . . from [the dictator's] last visit to America"") grows more desperately, menacingly isolated every day. In ""Delicate Edible Birds,"" a group of war correspondents--a lone, high-spirited woman among them--falls sudden prey to a brutal farmer while fleeing Nazis in the French countryside. In ""Lucky Chow Fun,"" Groff returns us to Templeton, the setting of her first book, for revelations about the darkness within even that idyllic small town.

In some of these stories, enormous changes happen in an instant. In others, transformations occur across a lifetime--or several lifetimes.

Throughout the collection, Groff displays particular and vivid preoccupations. Crime is a motif--sex crimes, a possible murder, crimes of the heart. Love troubles recur--they're in every story--love in alcoholism, in adultery, in a flood, even in the great flu epidemic of 1918. Some of the love has depths, which are understood too late; some of the love is shallow, and also understood too late. And mastery is a theme--Groff's women swim and baton twirl, become poets, or try and try again to achieve the inner strength to exercise personal freedom.

Overall, these stories announce a notable new literary master. Dazzlingly original and confident, Delicate Edible Birds further solidifies Groff's reputation as one of the foremost talents of her generation.",short-stories

What was the purpose and meaning of this extraordinary project that the Nazis called ""The Final Solution?"" In this pathbreaking book, Richard Koenigsberg shows how genocide grew out of the logic of warfare. Hitler reasoned that if he had the right to sacrifice his soldiers, he also had the right to send Jews to their deaths.
Hitler embraced his role as military leader, stating in the mid-thirties that if millions of Germans had to die in the next war, he would not shrink from this sacrifice. Based on a meticulous reading of Hitler's speeches and Mein Kampf, Koenigsberg shows how Hitler's thinking about warfare led to his decision to exterminate the Jews. Hitler reflected that if he had no compunctions about sending the ""best"" people to die in battle--German soldiers--why would he not also have the right to send the ""worst"" people--mortal enemies of Germany--to their deaths?
Nations Have the Right to Kill focuses on World War I and the Holocaust as two instances of societal mass-slaughter. Hitler fought in the First World War, witnessed the death of hundreds of his comrades, and knew that two million German soldiers had perished. He understood that soldiers are required to go into battle when their nations ask them to do so. But if nations can ask their healthiest and best people to die, why can they not also ask their least healthy and worst people to die? Koenigsberg shows how both the euthanasia program and Holocaust grew out of this line of thought.
Nazi ideology revolved around the idea that everyone was required to die for Germany. Just as German soldiers gave their bodies over to the nation-state--became obedient unto death--so Jews would be compelled to do so. The Final Solution sought to convey the message: ""Do not imagine that anyone is exempt from the obligation to suffer and to die for Germany!""",NA

The author of the bestselling books In The Midst of My Blackness, STUD; Dispelling The Myths, The Memoirs of Madlyn F. Glover; A love & Romance with Ray Charles Robinson brings us Got Homophobia! Got Homophobia is one of the most profound books written about Americaâs youth being bullied to death, and hate as a whole. This remarkable book asks the hard questions; what is America doing about gay youth suicide, why is homophobia taught as the norm, why are SGL/ LGBT youth and people are consistently treated as second class citizens?

This rare book speaks on how homophobia and heterosexism are directly connected to bullying, and how the isolation sometimes leads to dangerous behaviors and suicide.

Got Homophobia is timely and innovative. This book is jaw dropping, pain filled, yet uplifting and informative. The book takes us on a vibrant journey into Azaanâs youth and the youth of her brother Dijan Bruttus. The book paints pictures of the pain and agony of bullying, and the scars it leaves behind.

Got Homophobia also speaks on the five young people who were recently bullied to death. The book takes a hard look at faith based rights, HIV/AIDS, the church, and Dr. and Mrs. King support of SGL/LGBT people. The book also provides tips on bullying prevention and intervention. The book speaks about the schools responsibility to protect your child during school hours or while the child is on campus, and how do affirm your child if you think he or she is SGL/LGBT! This mind-boggling book makes a bold statement that we as a nation must fight bullying and intolerance as a whole.

Azaan assures the reader that whatever your age, culture, race or religion, you will find this amazing book uplifting, reassuring, and an overall great read!

What People Are Saying About Got Homophobia!

I am sharing my story of child abuse not only to help you be aware of your own surroundings but mostly to make you pay very close attention to the children in your lives.

My goal is to make you aware of the very real monsters that are out there in our everyday lives. Make sure that you are very careful who you bring into your childrenâs lives. You must be there to protect them and stay involved in their lives always.

Let them know that you are on their side. Try to teach your child what is right and what is wrong Tell them that you love them and make sure they know that they can trust you enough to tell you anything. Give your child a hug and a smile at least once a day.

I have not shared my story before now. I have survived life living day to day telling myself to leave the past in the past. Maybe I was ashamed of what happened to me or maybe I was afraid to bring back all the sadness, fear, despair, and helplessness. Writing my story has been self healing, yet very frightening, because I had to relive my past as I wrote about it. During my writing process, I experienced horrible vivid nightmares.

Writing, thankfully has worked for me. The more I write; the fewer nightmares I have. I know a lot of abused people like me; have kept quiet all of their lives.

From the Book Jacket:

Dear ridiculously attractive person who just so happens to be holding Tasteful Nudes in his or her soft and supple yet commanding hands,

Hi. My name is Dave, and this is my very first collection of essays. As you can probably imagine, it pretty much has everything. In fact, if you like stories about stolen meat, animal attacks, young love, death, naked people, clergymen, rock 'n' roll, irritable Canadians, and prison, you have just hit a street called Easy because my book talks about all that stuff and a bunch of other stuff, too.

Getting back to that prison thing for a secondâI can think of almost no better place to read my book than from within the confines of a correctional facility. For starters, you will definitely have the time. Also, cozying up with a good book in front of your fellow inmates is a great way to show them a softer side that for some reason no one ever wants to hear about in the yard.

Fear not, though, non-convicts, my book makes for a solid read outside of prison, too. At the beach, on the subway, while whitewater rafting, during couples counseling, under local anesthesiaâI have personally seen to it that my book is totally readable in all these scenarios, as well as in most other scenarios out there today. It will make you laugh, cry, and maybe even think so much that you will forget all your problems while simultaneously creating a few new ones. In limited instances it has been known to cause severe dehydration and the occasional groin pull, but honestly I don't know what that's about. That said, it's probably not a bad idea to keep a glass of water handy and really stretch things out before strapping yourself in for a literary thrill ride you will want to experience again and again until you are either dead or your eyesight fails completely, whichever comes first. In fact, if I end up being wrong about any of this stuff, you can kick me right in the privates. Also, I will send you a nice ham (serves twenty). In short, you really can't lose on this one.

Your man,

Dave Hill",humor

Why do seemingly good people, lifetime neighbors in a lovely Arizona town, turn viciously on some of their most innocent and beloved friends? How can one small spot on the edge of the greatest Grand Canyon on Earth, and the magnificent Colorado River, foster so many unkind deeds in its people? Flagstaff was a sacred grove in a cool Mountain climate, surrounded on all 4 sides by vast deserts. It was a holy pinnacle to the very ancient Beings who came there in the truest legends of many peoples, home of the Gods who loved its cosmic powers. Flagstaff, in fact was the Egyptian hieroglyphic for the gods and goddesses. But then Christians invaded from the east, bringing their opportunistic, anti-Nature greed for logging, railroads, cattle ranching, and tourists who only wanted to play and ski in the great sacred alpine heavens. They brought their hatred of non-christians, ""pagans,"" Natives and Natural Peoples and animals and water-streams, wooded groves, clean air and the dark quiet peace of the stars. Ancestors of author David Seals arrived 150 years ago on the sublime Colorado Plateau, as Les Voyageurs, French fur trappers from Quebec and Europe and Africa. His grandfather's grandfather David Daze {pronounced d'Ausay} followed his oldest sons on the adventure and arrived on the A& P railroad in the 1880s, and homesteaded near Mt. Sitgreaves and the town of Williams just west of the small railroad and logging town of Antelope Springs, later named Flagstaff. They were drawn to the freedom and beauty near the vast Grand Canyon, where mysteries in the skies also drew Percival Lowell to set up his studies of Mars and Martians in the 1890s. Lowell believed in divine, extraterrestrial Beings, and saw them many times from his Observatory on Mars Hill, and there re-began the modern lore of the heavenly Astronauts, so thoroughly explained from sunken caelestial civilizations like Mu and Atlantis, all the way back to Egypt and Greece. The grandson of David Daze, David O'Brien, arrived in Flagstaff from Canada as a boy in the 1890s, and was a close friend and neighbor of Lowell. Dave O'Brien's only daughter Kathleen was born in Flagstaff in 1924, and her oldest son David Seals was conceived at Roswell, New Mexico in 1946-47 after she'd married an AAF pilot during the terrible World War II. Family traditions often spoke of the heavenly Beings from Mars Hill that traveled to Roswell, and were seen and heard by young Davey at Air Force Bases around the world, where his father was stationed. In Japan in 1955-56 he heard Martians in their house - and it is chronicled in this book 'Flagstaff'. He heard the Martians abduct his sister Kathy and kill her. In Libya in 1962-65 the family was exposed to a lot of the sacred, true mythology in North Africa, and which is also chronicled here in the Author's own experiences. It was there, on Mt. Nysa at Tripoli, Leptis Magna, and the Temple of Liber Pater at Sabratha that he learned about the birth and origins of gods Dionysos/Osiris-Isis and Athene. Back in the States, he chronicles profound revelations about the family's horrible confrontations with the evils of people that went back to Flagstaff, and which is related to the ultraterrestrial visitations many people mistake for abductions, cosmic kidnappings, and the devils of false religions. Dave O'Brien was given a lobotomy, back in Flagstaff in the 1940s? Why? When he died in 1950 he was buried next to Kathleen's mother Bessie O'Brien - and both their tombstones were bulldozed by a crazed Catholic priest in the late 1950s, completely destroyed! Why? When Kathleen's stepmother Mollie O'Brien died in 1965, the family home of 35 years, at 515 N. Leroux in downtown Flagstaff, was taken by the neighbors, named Rayma Babbitt and Mollie Pertuit, for a mere pittance of $10. Kathleen was outraged, horrified. It was her home.

Newheart approaches the Go he Gospel of John is filled with poetry, imagery, symbolism, irony, rhythm . . . and soul. The gospel contains not concepts that speak to the mind, but poetry that speaks to the soul, the emotions, the imagination. In Word and Soul Michael Willett Newheart describes a way to read biblical literature ""soulfully"" and applies it to the Fourth Gospel.

Newheart approaches the Gospel of John as poetry and reads it poetically. He engages Johannine images and rhythms; and explores likenesses to those images and rhythms in the world of the reader. This ""soul reading"" of the gospel is influenced by three elements; analytical/archetypal psychology, which reorients psychology to ""the study of the soul""; African-American cultural experience, which is often characterized as ""soul""; and reader-response criticism, which emphasizes that the reading of a text is shaped by the reader's psychological and social location. After a brief discussion, selected portions of the Fourth Gospel are read from the perspective of ""soul.""

The biblical passages that are read include the conversations with Nicodemus and the Samaritan, disputes with the Judeans, the healing of the man born blind, and the raising of Lazarus, the first farewell discourse, Jesus' prayer to the Father, the trial before Pilate, and the resurrection appearances to Mary and to the disciples. With each passage, Newheart first translates a section from the gospel, then poetically engages the key images and rhythms of that section. He then considers the likenesses in twentieth-century African-American poetry, and finally, summarizes the likenesses of the Johannine images and rhythms in his own soul.

Chapters are ""ForeWord: The Johannine Prologue (John 1:1-18),"" ""Word for Word: Jesus' Conversations (John 2-4),"" ""My Word Against Your Word: Jesus' Disputes with the Judeans (John 5-8),"" ""(More of) My Word Against Your Word: Further Disputes with the Judeans (John 9-12),"" ""ByeWord: Jesus' Farewell Discourses (John 14-17),"" and ""UpWord: Jesus' Return to the Father (John 18-21).""",NA

If yes, this is the book for you. The fact that the reader may not have a scientific education does not mean that s/he does not have the intelligence to understand profound concepts -- as long as they are presented with semantic and epistemological clarity. After all, Einstein said that Science is simply the refinement of our intuition and everyday experiences.

Galloping with Light is a symbolic cavalcade that starts with the discovery of fire 1.5 million years ago; it allegorically employs the imagination of an adolescent called Einstein to explain the Theory of Relativity in non-scientific terms, and ends with the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon in 1969 -- depositing on lunar soil a laser retro-reflector which would prove, once again, that Einstein was right.

Motivated by his own difficulties to understand Relativity Theory, and convinced that it is possible to teach the layperson without distorting the subject matter, the author takes an approach utterly opposed to that of most popular science books. Knowing he has to demolish what the reader understands by time, distance, and motion, the author -using his experiences as a child, adolescent, and adult- dedicates the first half of the book to convince the reader that our intuition and common sense, as applied to those three everyday concepts, have a foundation as solid as that of a castle on the sand.

The purpose of this book is to demystify and 'defolklorize' the reader; to destroy the aura of mystery and incomprehensibility surrounding Relativity Theory, unmasking and debunking the body of popular (and scientific) beliefs (mostly erroneous) which -taking advantage of the confusion between relativity and subjectivity, as well as of Einstein's popularity and prestige- have been used to validate preposterous assertions in fields like psychology, morality, spirituality, sociology, literature, art, etc.

From the Author

At the beginning of 2008, I started my dream of finishing my life explaining the most profound concepts in Science to the big public, and decided to start doing so by writing this book about Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore. By Folklore, I mean the set of popular (and scientific) beliefs, mostly erroneous, associated with Relativity Theory and with our scientific activity in general.

In this new project as a writer of Popular Science, my objective is to reach the mass reader, that non-scientific person with the curiosity of understanding the Universe in which we live, who has the habit of reading and thinking and the respect for her/his own capacity of logical analysis and comprehension, and who is conscious of the relevance Science carries in current society, and the essential role it plays as a modeler of our destiny as a biological species.

Around my 14 years of age I avidly read a little book on Relativity Theory without understanding a thing. However, I was perplexed, because the three concepts about which the author elaborated upon over and over were precisely those which every 14-year kid had to be already intimately familiarized with, by the sheer fact of growing up: time, distance, and speed. What did I learn from that frustrating juvenile experience? That the author expected me to employ what every one of us (even adults) understands by time, distance, and speed to reach conclusions which only could be considered untrue and preposterous precisely because, had we considered them credible and sensible, we would have been compelled to throw away our millenary understanding of those three cherished concepts. What a peculiar approach, I said to myself: if the conclusion is going to destroy our deepest convictions, why not start analyzing those convictions, attempting to grasp the experiences, basic principles, and hypotheses that made us erroneously though vehemently believe in them for thousands of years?

What the non-scientific reader needs (as well as the scientist) is a book giving more importance to the intuitive physical meaning of the words than to the unmeasured erudition an author can display with them. My objective thus is not to turn the reader into an expert in Relativity; on the contrary: that would require a much bigger effort than simply reading this book. My purpose is to show that the Theory of Relativity, experimentally confirmed in the last hundred years, regardless of how strange and opposed to our prejudices (disguised in the mask of 'common sense') may seem to be, is rational, consistent, and intelligible for the layperson -- if, and only if, s/he has the audacity of accepting the unfounded nature of those preconceptions.

It is my desire and the honor of stimulating in the non-specialized person such a necessary intellectual boldness that have motivated me to write this book. These intellectual strength and courage have nothing to do with our academic or professional credentials; even more: had I believed they are strictly necessary to seize a concrete and positive message out of this book, I would have not gone through the trouble of writing it.

I thus dream for the reader finishing this book with the sensation that it is possible to achieve an acceptable understanding of the Theory of Relativity based on the objective truth and free of folklore (popular as well as scientific). And... if, after some time, the reader feels the urge to read my book again so as to strengthen his/her understanding, my ephemeral stay in Plato's cave will have had the sense and transcendence that all of us seek for our existence.

Secret societies, banking cartels, and terrorist regimes have been funding and grooming political candidates for the highest offices of American government. A one man sleeper cell has been in play since 2008. The American people blindly voted him into position. Or did they? In a day when it is becoming a crime to worship Jesus Christ, signs of the times and biblical prophecies are unfolding at ever increasing rates. The story starts way back in a time veiled from your mind, when you fought a war you don't remember, a war for your very right to be born. Events playing out on Earth are extensions of that war. The original foes know you better than you know yourself, and they cannot be killed. They were never alive. The story is a fictional dramatization framed around principles of eternal truth. Earth Sink will penetrate your soul to the core. You will not be able to remain neutral or indifferent after reading this book in its entirety. The open minded reader will find answers to some of manâs most profound questions and will likely come away with even more questions and some intensely emotional opinions. Earth Sink contains personal dreams experienced by the author and is based in part on the author's dreams. It is written mostly in narrative form with very little dialog. The eternal future of every individual on earth, alive or dead, hangs in the balance. A simple vicarious work can tip the scales toward eternal life. The sheer volume of vicarious work to be done is astronomical. Scant few ever attempt it. Will they endure long enough to complete the work, or will they succumb to the swelling tides of evil? While offering insights into theological anthropology and eschatology, Earth Sink depicts the tragic results of prevailing modern societal trends. The book exposes the primordial roots of political influences operating works of darkness that drive a progressive global state of affairs that exclusively favors the world's elites at the expense of liberty and individual freedoms. Earth Sink warns about the deliberate dismantling of the United States constitution from the inside by a compromised and corrupted executive branch of American government collaborating with secret combinations of banking cartels, mega corporations, and terrorist organizations. The most powerful position in the world is handed over to diabolical figures bent on seating a world government that opposes every virtue that once set mankind above beasts. The catastrophic consequences of globalized mainstream sociopolitical movements leading up to the second coming of Jesus Christ are unrelentingly drilled home in overwhelmingly graphic detail unleashed from the vivid and explosive imagination of the author. Earth Sink does not skimp on cataclysmic mayhem and apocalyptic doom. Take heed if you want to live. End times have already been underway longer than you realize. Earth Sink is a scathing and brutal portent. The author is absolutely unmindful of reader sensitivity. He employs no semblance of political correctness. Some readers may find parts of the story extremely disturbing, offensive, and controversial. Though written as fiction, the story alludes to the serious truth of what is going on around us and among us right now. In addition to whetting the inquisitive mind with a glimpse of cutting edge science and futuristic technologies, Earth Sink is both politically relevant and spiritually applicable to everyone. It describes a globalized society driven by influences that promote and then exploit worldwide pacifism, greed, envy, pride, and chaos which in turn drives a desperate need for change. Upon that desperate need for change, the world's elites slide into coveted positions of absolute power and total control while their bovine, unthinking constituents and porcine subjects wallow in passive complacency, recklessly relying on the mercies of those they have allowed to gain power over them. All will be well, or will it? Earth Sink extrapolates a possible future from past and present issues. Read the story as if it were real. Some of it is unequivocally real. Some of it may become real. Ponder it carefully and decide for yourself what is real and what is fiction. Beware, your time will soon run out. Earth Sink was written to do more than merely entertain.

Wedged between talkative, fidgety older brother Spencer (more equipped to interact with electronics than people) and younger sister Grace (a bubbly, pink-sequined, girly girl), tomboy Trish grew into the family g Written with the taut, plot-driven momentum of a fictional yarn, this true story reveals an insider's intimate details of the California dream gone horribly wrong.

Wedged between talkative, fidgety older brother Spencer (more equipped to interact with electronics than people) and younger sister Grace (a bubbly, pink-sequined, girly girl), tomboy Trish grew into the family golden child - ;unwittingly providing fuel for her narcissist father's cruelty. Add an alcoholic wannabe movie star mom and a Southern California community full of itself like no other and you have the ingredients for an unforgettable story.

Life for the author and her siblings ricocheted between forced conversations with beautiful people and a house rife with deafening silence. Eventually dreams of stardom eroded, tension became unbearable, and the family imploded. That was just the beginning.

Left on her own, Trish descended into a desperate world of addiction and riskâboth physical and emotionalâunimaginable from the spoiled, fantasy life of her childhood. A nineteen-year-old boyfriend introduced her to sex at thirteen and became her gateway into a world that her parents never could have imagined. You'll find yourself shaking your head in wonder as Trish uses her wide-angle (fisheye) observations to guide us through jaw-dropping experiences.

With remarkably adept word craft from a debut author, Thorpe explores issues that are both intensely private and startlingly universal. Drawn from journals she kept while working through personal issues, ""Fisheye"" carries us from the depths of the unthinkable to an ultimate place of positive reawakening. Yes there are elements of this story that appeal to us individually, but Thorpe's triumphant emancipation from her past belongs to us all.

Note: The author successfully weaves allusions to the Wonderful Wizard of Oz throughout her own odyssey. You'll find references to Dorothy's journey of self-discovery, replete with all the colorful characters and settings of the original parable.",non-fiction

This fast paced, biographical work contains layers of storyline with twists and turns that are poignant, and startling.

Join three young menâs true stories as they launch themselves onto the college football scene and refuse to be denied their impact both on and off the field. These mistakenly overlooked college football players take over a struggling football team with their drive and motivation, all in an effort to rise to the challenge of one more football season. Living on the edge of college life as driven athletes, they face a dramatic conspiracy as they struggle in the face of athletic romance, real world politics of organizational behavior and creating their own futures as they are forced to lead the world around them much sooner than they ever expected.

Heavy is the head that wears the crown as these extraordinary athletes have decisions to make that are crowded by circumstances that continually provide opportunities for them to fail in rising to the level of achievement that they know they have earned. Understanding their romantic interests and hearing their sex stories as they struggle not to be dragged under provides a highly insightful gaze into their world.

The dynamics of college football, deciding on a future and motivation for achievement are illustrated here in a true story of the thin line between being an exceptional football player and the ever expanding world of claims that all performers are equal despite the results that prove to differentiate those same performers. At a new school, on a new team, joining the college ranks, these young men face more reality than they anticipated as they hold their future in their own hands and are first hand participants in the real world evolution of organizational politicking, power struggles and the freedom to pursue the college endeavor as they see fit.

This true story is worth picking up simply to have an accurate overview of the inner workings and value of university education, college football and organizational manipulation. It serves as both a remarkable story of college life and as an instruction manual to the pitfalls of the people surrounding exceptional individuals, in addition to the political motivations of higher education organizations. College football, coaching motivations and the nature of organizational leaders is clearly depicted here as your guide.

It has been an unwavering friendship that has flourished for sixteen years. That is, until an unexplainable twist in circumstances causes Katherineâs name to appear on the Collectorâs List.

Oh, but do not mistake this as an end, this is just the beginning. Katherine refuses to hand over her soul quietly and Jonathan will stand beside his friend, feeling the bitter sting of helplessness as he realizes that he might possibly be the cause of her demise. So now a new relationship unfolds between them, one of checks and balances, hints, clues, and mysteries, where the two, despite their now forbidden friendship, will work together to manipulate the List.

But just as resolute, the law wonât stand idly by as Katherine assists in the deaths of others. Every form of law enforcement is preparing to conduct a global manhunt to bring her to justice. Nor will the Creator of the List tolerate a friendship that goes completely against his rules. The collections continue to increase in difficulty, pushing Katherine into an irreversible life of crime where the only possibility of escape is her own death. Yet Katherine, as impassionedly determined as a trapped animal trying to escape its captor, will stay the course in her fight to overcome Heaven, Hell, earth and â¦ the Collector.",fantasy

The first method, in which data is integrated through rational means, he calls Integration. The second, which employs non-rational means, he calls Misintegration. The third is Disintegrationâwhich is nihilism, the desire to tear things apart.Â In The DIM Hypothesis Peikoff demonstrates the power of these three methods in shaping the West, by using the categories to examine the culturally representative fields of literature, physics, education, and politics. His analysis illustrates how the historical trends in each field have been dominated by one of these three categories, not only today but during the whole progression of Western culture from its beginning in Ancient Greece.Â Extrapolating from the historical pattern he identifies, Peikoff concludes by explaining why the lights of the West are going outâand predicts the most likely future for the United States.",philosophy

A multi-threat entertainer and a world-class eccentric, Kay Thompson was the mentor/best friend of Judy Garland, the vocal guru for Frank Sinatra and Lena Horne, and the godmother/Svengali of Liza Minnelli (who recreated Thompsonâs nightclub act in her 2009 Tony Awardâwinning event, Lizaâs at the Palace).

She went to school with Tennessee Williams, auditioned for Henry Ford, got her first big break from Bing Crosby, trained Marilyn Monroe, channeled Elvis Presley, rejected Andy Warhol, rebuffed Federico Fellini, got fired by Howard Hughes, and snubbed Donald Trump.

She coached Bette Davis and Eleanor Roosevelt; she created nightclub acts for Marlene Dietrich and Ginger Rogers; and when Lucille Ball had to sing on Broadway, Kay was the wind beneath her wings, too.

Kayâs legion of fans included Queen Elizabeth of England, King Juan Carlos of Spain, and Princess Grace (Kelly) of Monaco. Danny Kaye masqueraded in drag as her; NoÃ«l Coward and Cole Porter wrote musicals for her; and The Beatles wanted to hold her hand. She was a charter member of the Rat Pack, costarred in a whodunit with Ronald Reagan, and directed John F. Kennedyâs Inaugural Gala.

The dame cut a wide swath through the arts. After conquering radio in the 1930s she commandeered MGMâs vocal department in the 1940s, where she revolutionized the studioâs greatest musicals with her audacious arrangements, from The Harvey Girls to Ziegfeld Follies.

In the 1950s she became the highest-paid cabaret attraction in the world with her groundbreaking act ""Kay Thompson and the Williams Brothers,"" featuring her young protÃ©gÃ©âand secret loverâAndy Williams.

In a stunning feat of reinvention, Thompson next became the bestselling author of Eloise (first published by Simon & Schuster in 1955), chronicling the mischievous adventures of the six-year-old mascot of The Plaza, spawning an industry that is still going strong today.

Then Kay took the silver screen by storm as the ""Think Pink!"" fashion magazine editor in Funny Face, stealing the film right out from under Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire.

The Thompson saga swells from small town wannabe to international headliner, dissolving into self-destruction and madnessâthe storyline usually reserved for a rags-to-riches potboilerâyet with unexpected twists, outlandish turns, and a last-minute happy ending that, even by Hollywoodâs standards, is nothing short of preposterous.

Society for U. S. Intellectual History Notable Title in American Intellectual History

The story of liberal religion in the twentieth century, Matthew S. Hedstrom contends, is a story of cultural ascendency. This may come as a surprise-most scholarship in American religious history, after all, equates the numerical decline of the Protestant mainline with the failure of religious
liberalism. Yet a look beyond the pews, into the wider culture, reveals a more complex and fascinating story, one Hedstrom tells in The Rise of Liberal Religion.

Hedstrom attends especially to the critically important yet little-studied arena of religious book culture-particularly the religious middlebrow of mid-century-as the site where religious liberalism was most effectively popularized. By looking at book weeks, book clubs, public libraries, new
publishing enterprises, key authors and bestsellers, wartime reading programs, and fan mail, among other sources, Hedstrom is able to provide a rich, on-the-ground account of the men, women, and organizations that drove religious liberalism's cultural rise in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. Critically,
by the post-WWII period the religious middlebrow had expanded beyond its Protestant roots, using mystical and psychological spirituality as a platform for interreligious exchange. This compelling history of religion and book culture not only shows how reading and book buying were critical
twentieth-century religious practices, but also provides a model for thinking about the relationship of religion to consumer culture more broadly. In this way, The Rise of Liberal Religion offers both innovative cultural history and new ways of seeing the imprint of liberal religion in our own

Our political and economic systems were designed for an infinite planet. These difficult truths anchor the perceptive analysis offered in The Other Road to Serfdom and the Path to Sustainable Democracy. With wit, energy, and a lucid prose style, Eric Zencey identifies the key elements of âinfinite planetâ thinking that underlie our economics and our politicsâand shows how they must change. Zenceyâs title evokes F. A. Hayek, who argued that any attempt to set overall limits to free marketsâany attempt at centralized planningâis âthe road to serfdom.â But Hayekâs argument works only if the planet is infinite. If Hayek is right that planning and democracy are irreducibly in conflict, Zencey argues, then on a finite planet, âfree markets operated on infinite planet principles are just the other road to serfdom.â The alternative is ecological economics, an emergent field that accepts limits to what humans can accomplish economically on a finite planet. Zencey explains this new school of thought and applies it to current political and economic concerns: the financial collapse, terrorism, population growth, hunger, the energy and oil industryâs social control, and the deeply rooted dissatisfactions felt by conservative âvaluesâ voters who have been encouraged to see smaller government and freer markets as the universal antidote. What emerges is a coherent vision, a progressive and hopeful alternative to neoconservative economic and political theoryâa foundation for an economy that meets the needs of the 99% and just might help save civilization from ecological and political collapse.",NA

Valentine is a young man, quite content with his life, until, one day, he meets a girl, by chance, who completely upends his world.

Karina is a young virginal student from Peru, living in London, for reasons unknown. With just one glance of her strange Incan beauty, Valentine is bewitched. From that moment on, his every thought is of her, his every feeling, his every dream. He is completely overwhelmed by an unaccountably powerful love. Yet, Karina is a mystery. Everything about her is elusive. Valentine is led on a mystery of the Heart, to discover the truth of the one he has come to love, so unexpectedly.

Why is she so mysterious? What is the truth of her life? How can he love someone who seems so indefinable?

They share a mutual uncontrollable passion â indeed, neither has known feelings so irresistible in their lives. Yet, always, there is the presence of the shadow of the unknown.

This is the true story of a great love. Valentine spent six years, at night, alone in a room, writing this book, after the last day he ever saw Karina. Its six volumes extend to approximately 750,000 words making this one of the longest books ever written in the English language â and perhaps the longest book of love, in any language, in history.

In New York Times bestselling author Tracy Chevalierâs newest historical saga, she introduces Honor Bright, a modest English Quaker who moves to Ohio in 1850, only to find herself alienated and alone in a strange land. Sick from the moment she leaves England, and fleeing personal disappointment, she is forced by family tragedy to rely on strangers in a harsh, unfamiliar landscape.

Nineteenth-century America is practical, precarious, and unsentimental, and scarred by the continuing injustice of slavery. In her new home Honor discovers that principles count for little, even within a religious community meant to be committed to human equality.

However, drawn into the clandestine activities of the Underground Railroad, a network helping runaway slaves escape to freedom, Honor befriends two surprising women who embody the remarkable power of defiance. Eventually she must decide if she too can act on what she believes in, whatever the personal costs.

Did God really intend to keep all this a secret? Or all the truths were always before us and we never came out of ourselves just to look around?

These and many more questions have intrigued us all our lives. The education o Why are we born? What is the universe? What is time? What is the reason behind everything? How should we live? What is the truth? What matters the most? Did God really intend to keep all this a secret? Or all the truths were always before us and we never came out of ourselves just to look around?

These and many more questions have intrigued us all our lives. The education of a child in ancient times had knowledge pertaining to these questions as an integral part. But as we moved towards modern times, we lost many things which matter the most. We have lost the way of our lives with no one to show us the light. All our education and knowledge revolve around making a living. But though it may be potent to tell us how to make a living, it fails to impart us the knowledge of how to live. Moreover, we seldom find any time to read any books concerning matters outside our vocational realm.

âThe Sojournâ is an attempt to fill the gap. In the most succinct yet captivating way, the book opens doors to many truths. It is a journey of not only our lives but the entire universe. By reading the book and totally immersing in it, the reader will find himself in a new dimension. His way of seeing everything will change. The truth, if manipulated, becomes a lie. The more efforts are made to hide it, the more it loses its identity. Therefore, what was always lying before us will be known to us forever. The truth is simple and elegant. Thatâs why it is the truth. By knowing its true nature and essence, we will see everything in its true grandeur.

On including âThe Sojournâ in the curriculums, the students will come to know how to conduct their lives in the most effective way. They will find a guiding light in any situation of their lives. On repeated readings, the book will become a part of their subconscious mind and consequently, their second nature. This will give them a meaning and purpose for their lives. Those who have passed their study phase can read the book and implement the principles in their lives. The book will change their perception and will help them find their purpose. They will find the ways to resolve anything, since they will know the reason and true nature of all the existence.

Thus, âThe Sojournâ is a book that will transform. When read with an open mind, and several times, new thoughts and truths will emerge each time, to ponder over. No matter whatsoever the situation a person may be in; on reading the book with a quiet mind and reflecting upon it, he will find solutions and ways out. With the limited time in our lives, these thirty five pages of poems will become a facilitator in real sense of the word. Therefore, the book is meant for everyone and will make the foundations of all civilizations very strong.

We can choose to live our lives by the Golden Rule. We can make time to appreciate the exquisite construction of our planet and experience the joys of nature.

I wrote this book to help more people - All of my life I have been a practitioner of the 'give-away' where I have done creative art, like carving stone, paintings, poetry, writings etc and then given them away to people that they could help - I carved a sacred stone called Catlinite which is used by the Native Americans to make their pipes for prayers into sacred Hebrew Letters (one of the sacred alphabets which represented - energies of creation) and gave them to people that needed healing - hundreds of them - I gave away the things most valuable to me to help - however - I was limited in reaching the number of people I wanted to help - I wrote this book and offer it commercially to help even more people with healing words and the magic of Maya. I could not reach the parents, grandparents, adults and children that I wanted to without commercial exposure - I am very grateful for this opportunity to help more people. Your purchase of this book allows me to 'give-away' even more to people that cannot afford to purchase like children in hospitals, like emotionally distraught adults that don't know where to turn, like grandparents that are on fixed incomes.

Next to the bo For fans of Alice Sebold and Scott Smith, a dark, gripping debut novel of literary suspense about a devastating murder in an isolated town that appears to be the work of a man with the mind of a childâbut could the truth be hidden in the swirling snow?

In the small town of Wyalusing in eastern Pennsylvania, a woman is found brutally murdered one winter night. Next to the body is Danny Bedford, a misunderstood man who suffered a tragic brain injury that left him with limited mental capabilities. Despite his simple life, his intimidating size has caused his neighbors to ostracize him in fear. So when the local bully-turned-deputy discovers Danny with the body itâs obvious that Dannyâs physical strength has finally turned deadly. But in the long, freezing night that follows, the murder is only the first in a series of crimes that viciously upset the town orderâan unstoppable chain of violence that appears to make Dannyâs guilt increasingly undeniable.

With the threat of an approaching blizzard, the local sheriff and a state trooper work through the pre-dawn hours to establish some semblance of peace. As they investigate one incident after another, they discover an intricate web of lies that reveals that not everything in Wyalusing is quite what it seems.

With echoes of Scott Smithâs A Simple Plan and Tana Frenchâs In the Woods, Deep Winter is a richly atmospheric and ingeniously plotted novel that is surprising to the final page. Itâs impossible to escape this bone-chilling story of deception where the truth is uncertain and something sinister is lurking just below the surfaceâ¦",mystery

Success, true love, and the life youâve always wanted. Many of us placed our faith in these things, believing they held the key to happiness, but with a sneaking suspicion they might not deliver. The recent economic meltdown has cast a harsh new light on these pursuits. In a matter of months, fortunes, marriages, careers, and a secure retirement have disappeared for millions of people. No wonder so many of us feel lost, alone, disenchanted, and resentful. But the truth is that we made lesser gods of these good thingsâgods that canât give us what we really need. There is only one God who can wholly satisfy our cravingsâand now is the perfect time to meet him again, or for the first time.

The Bible tells us that the human heart is an âidol-factory,â taking good things and making them into idols that drive us. In Counterfeit Gods, Keller applies his trademark approach to show us how a proper understanding of the Bible reveals the unvarnished truth about societal ideals and our own hearts. This powerful message will cement Kellerâs reputation as a critical thinker and pastor, and comes at a crucial timeâfor both the faithful and the skeptical.",christian

The five alien delegates from the Many Worlds Collective (MWC) come in hologram form to the selected liaison for Earth, Clara Branon, Ph.D., 58, for the first time on December 21, 2012, after several millennia of mostly secret visits and contact with Earthers. Members of the MWC InterGalactic Council decide that a liaison, dubbed the Chief Communicator (CC) must be contacted and that this contact must be made public in order to avert multiple types of disasters on Earth.

As a âSpanner,â Clara is one of millions of âBaby Boomersâ who survive across two centuries and bridge the divide (hence, âSpannersâ) between nonpublic and public contact with the MWC and many other major changes that occur during these decades.

Because most Earthers are not prepared to accept this type of reporting or storytelling as nonfiction, this first and some other volumes of the series are of the realistic fiction/science fiction/fantasy/ romance genres. Many of the characters, events and locations are actual; some are not, or havenât happened (yet) at the time of first publication.

In ""This Changes Everything"" are: a love story, spanning about 40 years; dialogue and scenes of the relationships among the CC and her mother and siblings; communications between the CC and her adult son; dialogue between the CC and some friends; info about the selection and identity of the chosen media contact for the CC, with excerpts from her journal; news stories about the CC and the MWC events from Earth media as well as MWC media; background about the CC and the reasons for her being selected; excepts from minutes of meetings of the InterGalactic Council of the MWC; and much more.

After the MWC educational resources and information become widely available, in 2013, all time is now known to be simultaneous. Writing from any point in time and timeline means that the love story and other aspects are depicted in multiple versions. Will Clara and her love, Epifanio Dang, be together? Which Re-set of the Transition After Public Contact prevails?

Tone is humorous/serious; mode is utopian. Narrative and themes include history, poetry, literature, music/lyrics, science and technological advances, psi phenomena/ paranormal skills, law and government, Buddhism and other religions, meditation, social-emotional intelligence, multiverse/multiple timelines, time and space travel, interspecies communication, and social/futuristic depictions of the Earth, post-MWC public contact.

""This Changes Everything"" is the first of ""The Spanners Series,"" which chronicles the public contact between the CC and the MWC and the impact of these contacts on Earthers and the MWC over the almost 30 years that Clara is the CC. Chapters are written from several perspectives. Some Volumes in series are purported to be nonfiction or have nonfiction sections, as this one is.

Sci-Fi/Romance/Speculative Fiction, Adult/ New Adult/YA genre novels are in the 10-volume series. Volume II, ""This Changes My Family and My Life Forever,"" releases in Spring, 2014.

Thanks to the killerâs handiwork, Tonyâs partners were also dead in Manhattan. The killer needed to finish his business in Westhampton tonight, so he could make his flight to Italy before any of the bodies were discovered. From his neck down he dressed like a surgeon with cotton coverings over his clothes and shoes that were specially made to fit although they were two sizes too large.

She shrieked in surprise and dropped the glass, which shattered. The killer reacted without conscious thought. He instinctively raised his gun and fired.

He turned and aimed at the sound, not realizing that his gun was pointed at a forty-five degree angle toward the floor. He fired again and there was silence.

But as I looked back, I realized that my safety net was no longer safe. I saw my entire company falling like dominoes. Medics were running left and right, risking their lives to help others with bravery that even the most amazing soldier couldnât hope to match. Some of the events I witnessed during that moment were beyond comprehension. I watched a young, courageous black medic take an 81-millimeter round to his head, and his whole body instantly turned to smoke. Young nineteen and twenty year old kids were crying like children, but fighting like someone had raped their sisters. So many things were going through my head at that moment, and in one single heartbeat I was overwhelmed with a flashback of my entire life. This is my story, from point A to B, of my life and times in the midst of hell on Earth.â",war
590,Lori's Song: The True Story of an American Woman Held Captive in Iran,Lori Foroozandeh,4.27,63,14,NA,0,"Though she endured a childhood of physical and sexual abuse, nothing would ever equal what happened to her in Iran the weeks following 9/11.

Lori, an American married to an Iranian, had been working and living as an ordinary member of Iranian society for almost 4 years when she had heard rumors that the U.S. was going to be attacked. That was on September 9, 2001. She tried Though she endured a childhood of physical and sexual abuse, nothing would ever equal what happened to her in Iran the weeks following 9/11.

Lori, an American married to an Iranian, had been working and living as an ordinary member of Iranian society for almost 4 years when she had heard rumors that the U.S. was going to be attacked. That was on September 9, 2001. She tried and failed to call home and give warning.

The news that all those rumors were horribly true came on September 11th 2001. That was when her husband suddenly announced that they had to go back to the States in case there were repercussions.

On September 12, 2001, Lori and her husband were at the Shiraz bus terminal intending to catch a bus to Istanbul and from there to Heathrow and home to the U.S.A. They were totally unprepared for the convoy of troop carriers that suddenly drove up and the armed men who came pouring out to take the hapless couple prisoner.

There was no explanation offered. The men took Lori's husband one direction and she another, pushing them blindfolded into the back of the troop carriers with other prisoners, mostly Iranian.

Who the armed men were was anybody's guess but they took their prisoners to POW camp in unfamiliar territory and there, Lori was held, tortured, raped, and starved with them for over a month. Her husband was not to be seen again.

Lori was rescued with one of her fellow inmates by the girl's family and, after riding a llama for 1-2 days over mountainous terrain; she arrived at the Iran Immigration center. By then, she weighed in at only 70 pounds, was still suffering from the many injuries she'd received at the hands of her torturers, and wanted badly to get home to her family in the USA. Even then, she had to fight Iranian Islamic bureaucracy to have permission to go, as the husband was unavailable to grant it. In any Islamic country, unknown to many western women, the husband or guardian's permission is always required for a woman to travel anywhere.

Lori had been married to Mohammad for 9 years and thought she could trust him but, since their arrival in Iran in 1998, his personality and behavior had changed so radically as to make this most recent nightmare highly suspicious.

The events told here are true. It was no coincidence that this American citizen had been placed into a concentration camp. In fact, it raises many questions and should be a caution to many!",horror
