In the first movement of Solo we meet Ulrich, the son of a railroad engineer, who has two great passions - the violin and chemistry. Denied the first by his father, he leaves for the Berlin of Einstein and Fritz Haber to study the latter. His studies are cut short when his father's fortune evaporates, and he must return to Sofia to look after his parents. He never leaves Bulgaria again. Except in his daydreams; and it is those dreams we enter in the volatile second half of the book. In a radical leap from past to present, from life lived to life imagined, Dasgupta follows Ulrich's fantasy children, born of communism but making their way into a post-communist world of celebrity and violence.
Intertwining science and heartbreak, the old world and the new, the real and imagined, Solo is a virtuoso work.",fiction

Despite this bold declaration, Reaganâs actions proved detrimental to the cause of human freedom all over the world. In this short but compelling polemic, Hurn examines The Gipperâs record abroad from a perspective of human rights, shining light on his administrationâs wrongdoings from Haiti to Iraq to Western Africa.
The book not only calls into question the greatness of Reagan's foreign policy, it asserts definitively that millions of people suffered because of it. Exploring a series of rarely publicized issues, President Reagan, the facilitator of genocide, the sponsor of terrorism, the abettor of death squads and steadfast ally of despots and warlords far and wide is summarily exposed â and the myth of Ronald Reagan as a crusader for global liberty is expertly laid to rest.",history

A sharp-edged satire with heart, Arts & Entertainments is the story of Handsome Eddie Hartley who, at thirty-three, has forgone dreams of an acting career for the reality of life as a drama teacher at a boysâ prep school. But when Eddie and his wife, Susan, discover they cannot have children, it is one disappointment too many.

Weighted down with debt, his wifeâs mounting unhappiness, and his own deepening sense of failure, Eddie is confronted with an alluring solution when an old friend-turned-web-impresario suggests Eddie sell a sex tape he made with an ex-girlfriend, now a wildly popular television star. Overcoming his initial moral qualms, Eddie figures that in an era when any publicity is good publicity, the tape wonât cause any harmâa decision that will have disastrous consequences and propel him straight into the glaring spotlight he once thought he craved.

A hilariously biting and incisive take-down of our cultureâs monstrous obsession with fame, Arts & Entertainments is also a poignant and humane portrait of a young manâs belated coming-of-age, the complications of love, and the surprising ways in which the most meaningful lives often turn out to be the ones we least expected to lead.",fiction

âA novel of the American Revolution by a writer who is himself a true American revolutionary.â âMark Edmundson, author of Why Teach?

In 1782, during the final clashes of the Revolutionary War, one of our young nationâs most valiant and beloved soldiers was, secretly, a woman.

When Deborah Samson disguised herself as a man and joined the Continental Army, she wasnât just fighting for Americaâs independence--she was fighting for her own. Revolutionary, Alex Myersâs richly imagined and meticulously researched debut novel, brings the true story of Deborahâs struggle against a rigid colonial society back to life--and with it the courage, hope, fear, and heartbreak that shaped her journey through a countryâs violent birth.

After years as an indentured servant in a sleepy Massachusetts town, chafing under the oppressive norms of colonial America, Deborah canât contain her discontent any longer. When a sudden crisis forces her hand, she decides to finally make her escape. Embracing the peril and promise of the unknown, she cuts her hair, binds her chest, and, stealing clothes from a neighbor, rechristens herself Robert Shurtliff. Itâs a desperate, dangerous, and complicated deception, and becomes only more so when, as Robert, she enlists in the Continental Army.

What follows is an inspiring, one-of-a-kind journey through an America torn apart by war: brutal winters and lethal battlefields, the trauma of combat and the cruelty of betrayal, the joy of true love and the tragedy of heartbreak. In his brilliant Revolutionary, Myers, who is a descendant of the historical Deborah, takes full advantage of this real-life heroineâs unique voice to celebrate the struggles for freedom, large and small, like never before.",historical

This international bestseller challenges everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success.

Since the dawn of the industrial age, companies have engaged in head-to-head competition in search of sustained, profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.

In the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating ""blue oceans""âuntapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call âvalue innovation,â create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.

Blue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future.",business

As the host of the wildly popular TV series Catfish which investigates online relationships to determine whether they are based on truth or fiction (spoiler: it's almost always fiction).

Nev has become the Dr. Drew of online relationships. His clout in this area springs from his own experience with a deceptive online romance, about which he made a critically acclaimed 2010 documentary (also called Catfish).

Now Nev brings his expertise to the page, sharing insider secrets about:

-what motivates catfish
-why people fall for catfish
-how you can avoid being deceived
-rules for dating -- both online and off
-how to connect authentically with others over the internet
-how to turn an online relationship into a real-life relationship

What we don't see is how both powerful and ordinary people are remaking their lives as their country dramatically changes.
As the Beijing correspondent for The New Yorker, Evan Osnos was on the ground in China for years, witness to profound political, economic, and cultural upheaval. In Age of Ambition, he describes the greatest collision taking place in that country: the clash between the rise of the individual and the Communist Party's struggle to retain control. He asks probing questions: Why does a government with more success lifting people from poverty than any civilization in history choose to put strict restraints on freedom of expression? Why do millions of young Chinese professionals-fluent in English and devoted to Western pop culture-consider themselves ""angry youth,"" dedicated to resisting the West's influence? How are Chinese from all strata finding meaning after two decades of the relentless pursuit of wealth?

Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orpha The definitive biography of a larger-than-life president who defied norms, divided a nation, and changed Washington forever

Andrew Jackson, his intimate circle of friends, and his tumultuous times are at the heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern presidency. Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jackson's election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson's presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human drama-the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers- that shaped Jackson's private world through years of storm and victory.

One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will- or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White House-from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman-have found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision.

Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe-no matter what it took.",history

""Van Booy is a writer whose work I will forever eagerly read."" -Robert Olen Butler

Whether they are pursued by Nazi soldiers, old age, shame, deformity, disease, or regret, the varied characters of Simon Van Booy's utterly compelling novel The Illusion of Separateness discover in their darkest moments of fear and isolation that they are not alone, that they were never alone, that every human being is a link in an unseen chain.

This gripping, emotional story intertwines the stories of several compelling characters: a deformed German infantryman; a lonely British film director; a young, blind museum curator; Jewish-American newlyweds separated by war; a lost child on the brink of starvation; and a caretaker at a retirement home for actors in Santa Monica. The same world moves beneath each of them, and one by one, through seemingly random acts of selflessness, they discover the vital parts they have played in each other's lives, a realization that shatters the illusion of their separateness.

Glory and her family move from Boston city life to rural cow country where people have heard of Jews but never seen a real one. A coming of age tale of a girl who doesn't understand why her sister won't talk to her and even Mother Nature seems out to get her. She cries out to the gods for help. But nobody sees her terrible self inflicted wounds. No one is paying attention. In this coming of age debut novel, C.F. Joyce explores the roles that family histories, clashing cultures, and dysfunctions play in the life of a young girl.

Under the unpublished title ""Memories of Glory"", the novel won a HarperCollins Top 5 Gold Medal award. Here are some of the reviewer's comments:

""It is very difficult to approach a âcoming of ageâ story, and write in such a way as to not appear clichÃ©d, but [the author] has made a remarkably strong case. In âMemories of Gloryâ, the journey from childhood to adulthood is dealt with in a unique way; the six children in Gloryâs family are used to explore various different facets of growing up. The reader is also able to understand more about the pasts of Gloryâs parents and their families, allowing adult tensions to be explored too. A compelling feminist take on life dominates, but the feelings of the important men in Gloryâs life are not left uncovered. The memories she recalls do not depict a clear straightforward story, rather each is a part of a puzzle which in the end paints an often brutal but fair conclusion on life...Glory is set up well as a whimsical day-dreamer. She lives in an alter-world, and her intelligence and desire to be elsewhere helps build a strong picture of her imagination. Gradually it becomes clear that the world she fashions for herself is an escape from the harsh life that she has had to lead. As a protagonist she is wonderful; her suffering is a result of both her surroundings and of universal teenage trauma: I found her hugely accessible...The use of dialogue, and the focus on different characters in each recollection, allows the reader to build a strong concept of each family member, and their relationships with one another. This is a vibrant read, and no connection is left unexplored. Friendship, as well as sibling rivalry, is beautifully drawn out...The author clearly has a gift for wit and charm, illustrated in the passage where the family go blueberry picking...The role of âMother Natureâ, of fate and fortune, is an interesting theme and one that gives an interesting dimension to the familyâs attitude.""",NA

Even as a smoker, Alison was certain that she would never be like those smokers. She was certain that if ever she ailed from the pernicious habit, she would quit. But When smokers coughed and coughed and couldn't stop coughing, Alison Beard made the same snide remarks as anyone who has never smoked: smoke another one! She asked the same question: why don't they just quit?


Even as a smoker, Alison was certain that she would never be like those smokers. She was certain that if ever she ailed from the pernicious habit, she would quit. But then her lungs begin to collapse, and she has to quit smoking.


In her heartfelt memoir Quit or Die Trying, Alison shares the crazy cocktails of medicine and diversion tactics she employs in her attempt to rid herself of her addiction. Having tried to quit more times than she kept count, she identifies the false assumptions and unhelpful social attitudes to reveal changes that would have a powerful impact on the success rate of quitting.


Fifty years after the monumental 1964 Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health, more than 50 million Americans still smoke. What follows is a candid, irreverent, eye-opening story about one woman's struggle to overcome her nicotine addiction.

Although up to 90% of us pray, very few of us feel like we've mastered prayer. A Year of Living Prayerfully is a fascinating, humorous, globe-trotting exploration of prayer that will help you grow your own prayer life.

While filming a documentary about sex trafficking, Jared and Michelle Brock felt a deep need for prayer in their personal lives. In an effort to learn more about prayer, the couple traveled the globe, exploring the great Judeo-Christian prayer traditions: in mountains and monasteries, in Christian communities and cathedrals, standing up and lying down, every hour and around the clock.

Jared's witty reflections on his fast-paced journey will both entertain and inspire you to think about your own prayer journey.

Join Jared on a rollicking modern-day prayer pilgrimage... you'll never pray the same again.",non-fiction

Lured by a yearning for freedom, tenacious curiosity, and hunger for adventure, Joy discovers hope and magic amid the misery, and power in her promise to care for those remaining, whom she loves enough to risk her life for. To save them, herself, and the boy she adores from the abuse and slavery by the Superiors, Joy must entrust the aid of an unlikely ally who harbors a dangerous secret.
With an intriguing stranger at the helm, Joy and the treemakers embark on an intense and terrifying, yet liberating quest for the truth about the existence of the forbidden paradise beyond The Wall.

When the Nazis i Outcry - Holocaust Memoirs, a profoundly moving autobiography

Manny Steinberg spent his teens in Nazi extermination camps in Germany and Poland, miraculously surviving while millions perished. This is his story. Born in 1925 in the Jewish ghetto in Radom (Poland), Manny soon realized that people of Jewish faith were increasingly being regarded as outsiders. When the Nazis invaded in September 1939 the nightmare started. The cityâs Jewish population had no chance of escaping and was faced with starvation, torture, sexual abuse and ultimately deportation. Outcry is the candid and moving account of a teenager who survived four Nazi camps: Dachau, Auschwitz, Vaihingen and Neckagerach. While being subjected to torture and degradation, he agonized over two haunting questions: ""Why the Jews?"" and ""How can the world let this happen?"" These questions remain hard to answer.

Mannyâs brother Stanley had jumped off the cattle wagon on the way to the extermination camp where his mother and younger brother were to perish. Desperately lonely and hungry, Stanley stood outside the compound hoping to catch a glimpse of Manny and their father. Once he discovered that they were among the prisoners, he turned himself in. The days were marked by hunger, cold, hard labor, and fear. Knowing that other members of the family were in the same camp kept them alive. Since acknowledging each other would have meant death, they pretended to be complete strangers. Manny relates how he was served human flesh and was forced to shave the heads of female corpses and pull out their teeth. Cherishing a picture of his beloved mother in his wooden shoe, he miraculously survived the terror of the Polish and German concentration camps together with his father and brother. When the Americans arrived in April 1945, Manny was little more than a living skeleton, with several broken ribs and suffering from a serious lung condition, wearing only a dirty, ragged blanket. This autobiography was written to fulfill a promise Manny made to himself during his first days of freedom. By publishing these Holocaust memoirs, the author wants to ensure that the world never forgets what happened during WWII. The narrative is personal, unencumbered and direct. Outcry touches the reader with its directness and simplicity. The story is told through the eyes of an old man forcing himself to relive years of intense suffering. It is an account of human cruelty, but also a testimony to the power of love and hope.

Memoirs worthy of being adapted for the big screen.

""I read this book with a very heavy heart and tears running down my face. For Manny's endurance and his brother Stanley to be so tested is truly a testament to life!""

""Very well written as it goes straight to the reader's heart!"" ""Manny Steinberg shares his extraordinary teenage story of surviving four concentration camps in an account noteworthy for its straightforward, unencumbered narrative. His is a story almost everyone can imagine happening to themselves - no less harrowing than more dramatic renditions of Holocaust survival, but somehow more compelling, and universal, for the unembellished simplicity of his style.""

Living off her inheritance, Olivia didnât need to work, but she knew she needed something to make her feel like life was worth living. Painting was her one true love, but that wasnât enough. So she started a part-time job in a bar, and the rest of the time she spent at a local soup kitchen, feeding the homeless. In the mornings, she bought hot beverages for her homeless friends, but there was one who never asked. This man, having the most facial hair sheâd ever seen, the most captivating eyes sheâd ever stared at, remained aloof. He never said a word to anyone, and never once looked her way. However, all this did was make Olivia want to find out more about this mysterious man hiding behind a face full of hair.

One perilous evening, her wish came true.

On the way back from working at the bar, Olivia was attacked. She screamed for help, relieved when her cries are answered...but surprised when she saw who her rescuer was. It was the eyes. It was the hair. It was none other than the mysterious homeless man.

That night, Olivia learned two things. One, his name was Kit, and two, Kit had skillsâ¦ skills which didnât fit a man living on the streets.

Day after day, Olivia slowly pushed the boundaries, coaxing out the man hiding behind the hair. Kit Chain wasnât only trained like men she watched in movies, he was also the most beautiful. Bit by bit, Olivia managed to break down his walls, revealing secrets that would change her life. Secrets that would put both of them in terrible danger.

Somewhere between routine discipline with horsewhips, gun-waving gambling debt collectors, and LSD-laced breakfast cereal adventures, tragedy strikes a blow from which Jules may never recover.

Jules's story alternates with that of her grandfather, Szaja, an Orthodox Jew who survives the murderous Ukranian pogroms of the 1920s, the Majdanek death camp, and the torpedoing of the Mefkura, a ship carrying refugees to Palestine. Unable to deal with the horrors he endures at the camp, Szaja develops a dissociative disorder and takes on the persona of a dead soldier from a burial ditch, using that man's thoughts to devise a plan to escape to America.

While Szaja's and Jules's sorrows are different on the surface, adversity requires them both to find the will to live despite the suffering in their lives--and both encounter, in their darkest moments, what could be explained as serendipity or divine intervention. For Jules and Szaja, these experiences offer the hope they need to come to the rescue of their own fractured lives.",new-adult

Couples therapist Resmaa Manakem challenges couples not to avoid conflictâDonât be afraid to rock the boat! The emotional transformation that results can forge a greater, more mature intimacy; a deeper trust; and a stronger bond.

Conflict is a natural part of any intimate relationship. Yet most couples either avoid it or try to smooth over their differences. This results in at least one partner compromising their integrityâand stunting their own growth. Gritty, often irreverent, and always practical, Rock the Boat challenges couples not to flee from conflicts, because the emotional stalemate that conflicts produce creates an opportunity for profound transformation. This transformation affirms each partnerâs individuality while forging a more mature intimacy, a greater trust, and a deeper bond. Rock the Boat challenges the idea that conflict between partners is unhealthy or something to avoid. Instead, it encourages both people to stand by what they need and who they areâbut to do so with compassion rather than competitiveness or vengefulness. This is the purpose of an intimate relationship: to create an atmosphere where both people learn to grow up and mature in their relationship by appreciating each otherâs individual needs in a caring and mature way.

Author Resmaa Menakem, a licensed clinical social worker specializing in couples therapy, addresses key factors in making this happen, including accepting discomfort and uncertainty; honesty and openness about sex, money, kids, and in-laws; recognizing when conflict might escalate into violence or abuse; and, when appropriate, finding and working with a good therapist.

New Consumer Tech: SMARTPHONE STREAMS DIRECTLY INTO HUMAN BRAIN

Smartbrain
-an eerily predictive, 2-part Novel

Part 1: Mind
Sarah Whiting, young, attractive, tech-savvy homebody, accepts a potentially lucrative offer to join a product/market analysis team that is performing the final evaluation of the believed technological breakthrough of the century before its release to the public. As the incredible opportunity unfolds, Sarah finds herself smitten with the technology, as well as with the projectâs lead engineer. Even with the contrast of taking care of her Alzheimerâs-ridden father, it all seems like a dream-come-true for Sarah. That is, until she abruptly learns that she may now be unwittingly mired in a dangerous ruse of international deception, and that the man sheâs fallen for, as well as this new, highly transformative technology may originate from somewhere else, other than Earth.

Part 2: Matter
Sarahâs world is further thrown into chaos and confusion when she wakes up with little memory of her recent past and is told that she is a victim of severe brain injury brought on by the very technology she had been working with. Sarah is lost in the revelation, loath to accept the reality being told her, and soon falls into a downward spiral fueled by a husband she doesnât remember, along with the abysmal fear that she may actually be losing her mind. What Sarah doesnât realize is that as she fights to gain a hold on what is real, others are in the process of risking their lives in a desperate attempt to free her from her perceptual prison. Filled with guilt, the very man who blames himself for Sarahâs cerebral incarceration begins to work with a group of highly trained professionals who might just be Sarahâs only hope of ever returning to her real life.

Smartbrain Universe
-and the Penchant Series

Smartbrain, a two-part novel and the first in the Penchant Series, introduces the Reader to a burgeoning, future universe where new, uber-immersive consumer technology creates the potential for worlds of augmented realism that exceeds ordinary, high-definition reality by inestimable measures.

Is technology truly leading us to a better world?

Will innovation and technology ultimately save our environment from self-induced catastrophe?

Are we, because of technology, losing an important part of our humanity?

Will this new universe of technology be just another contributor to the separation of the classes?

Would technology like this help balance, or destroy world economics?

Will we become so dependent on technology that we can no longer survive in the natural world?

To what degree, or limit, can technology and biology combine?

Can, or will, AIâartificial intelligenceâactually supersede human intelligence?

Will technology truly help us reach out and colonize the heavens?

Will technology enable us to learn that we are not alone in the universe, or ultimately to find out that we are?

Technology has already defined an entire new epoch in Earthâs history; will this be the final one? Moreover, if not, what could possibly come next?

Focusing on some of the more unusual verses from the Bible, the Qurâan, and Gita, author Babar Shah Khan highlights certain facts about holy book verses and clarifies some misguided interpretations about these verses, and he shares his ideas on Godâs evolution by comparing these spiritual texts.



How and Why God Evolved highlights the link among pagan, polytheistic, and monotheistic beliefs. Khan points out misrepresentations of Holy Scriptures and discusses some of the political reasons involved. He brings to the forefront the importance of understanding how the notion of God evolved throughout history, in keeping with the human brainâs development. He also shows how God and humans have fashioned each other in an attempt to understand and reach one another.



Khan exposes the textual commonalities among Holy Books and shows how modern-day religions spring from previous religions. How and Why God Evolved discusses why no one religion is truly unique or separate from others. They are all connected deeply by similar rites, rituals, and reasons; all religions share more commonalities than differences.

Born in Gainesville An exhilarating and intimate account of the life of music legend Tom Petty, by an accomplished writer and musician who toured with Petty

No one other than Warren Zanes, rocker and writer and friend, could author a book about Tom Petty that is as honest and evocative of Petty's music and the remarkable rock and roll history he and his band helped to write.

Born in Gainesville, Florida, with more than a little hillbilly in his blood, Tom Petty was a Southern shit kicker, a kid without a whole lot of promise. Rock and roll made it otherwise. From meeting Elvis, to seeing the Beatles on Ed Sullivan, to producing Del Shannon, backing Bob Dylan, putting together a band with George Harrison, Dylan, Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne, making records with Johnny Cash, and sending well more than a dozen of his own celebrated recordings high onto the charts, Tom Petty's story has all the drama of a rock and roll epic. Now in his mid-sixties, still making records and still touring, Petty, known for his reclusive style, has shared with Warren Zanes his insights and arguments, his regrets and lasting ambitions, and the details of his life on and off the stage.

This is a book for those who know and love the songs, from ""American Girl"" and ""Refugee"" to ""Free Fallin'"" and ""Mary Jane's Last Dance,"" and for those who want to see the classic rock and roll era embodied in one man's remarkable story. Dark and mysterious, Petty manages to come back, again and again, showing us what the music can do and where it can take us.",music

In searching for the girl he will discover a new and unimaginable corruption hiding beneath a corporate faÃ§ade â¦ and come face to face with a ruthless killer known to his victims only by a macabre appellation: Boneless Chuck.

What begins as a simple disappearance morphs into something far more insidious as John finds himself plunged into a horrifying world of organ harvesting, torture, mutilation, and madness. Every dark trick John learned in his former trade of dealing death to the deserving will be brought to bear as he tries to keep his promise of bringing the girl back alive. In doing so, not only will his skills be tested to the breaking point, but his very sanity as he battles a grasping evil that stretches across the globe.

But darkness has met its match. Because sometimes it takes a man whoâs spent quality time in the realms of the damned â¦ to send someone else there. So strap down and hang on.

John Brenner has just been dropped into hell.

From the book: âSon.â My voice degenerated to a guttural rasp. âDonât make me kill you.â I was thinking of Sarah. She really didnât need to have this added to her experience. I was asking for her sake. âPlease.â

I held my mark.

Still smiling, his knuckle grew white as it tightened down on the Glockâs trigger, taking up the last half-ounce of slack as his eyes flickered his intent. Sarah moaned in fear.

And then everything stopped as my Browning roared, its round rocketing six feet across the room and straight into his open blue eye.

The bullet mushroomed as it hit, growing instantly from the size of a pea to the diameter of a gumdrop. Thatâs what hollow points do. As the round exited his head at that short distance the entire back of his skull vanished in a spray of pink and gray, his gun flying free and unfired from his limp hand as he slumped to the floor, deader than four oâclock.

Param Dharm was written in the morning dawn (Brahm Muhurt) on the first Thursday of spring season in the year 2007 by Param Pujya Adhyatmik Neta Krishna Mohan Shankar Yogi in the state of ecstacy (samadhi).

âParam Dharmâ is the origin of Dharm. âParam Dharmâ is that innate form of Dharm which people have forgotten. Life is full of pleasure and happiness. âParam Dharmâ gives us the direction for living a prosperous life. âParam Dharmâ makes the way for living of standard and life of standard together.

âParam Dharmâ is not a bunch of thousands of words. It is not a vast description and analysis. âParam Dharmâ is the briefest Granth but contains everything about a real spritual life. Once you do 'paath' of ""PARAM DHARM"" in full concentration, a very beautiful image of life will be generated in your mind.

Usually people believe dharm as a part of life by which god is made happy or a life that is very simple, away from all kinds of comforts and luxuries. You will find it very difficult to accept if we say that a person, who gives importance to his desires, likes and dislikes, eats and dresses well and has all kinds of comforts , may be a saint . Perhaps saints wear simple yellow or white clothes only. They eat while sitting on the floor only(suits better if pattal is there), vermilion on forehead is very important, long beard will famous them soon as a saint or babaji. Very lengthy and attractive lectures lead them to a higher position of 'mahant' from saint. His popularity depends upon his taletelling abilities.

But we believe that this is not what a saint means. Then what is dharm? what a saint means ? why only dharm is the origin of life?

we have said before in the beginning that by doing 'paath' of ""PARAM DHARM"" a very beautiful movie of life begins to run in mind . This life is the root form of dharm . All the misunderstandings about dharm have vanished of those people who have listened its 'paath'. They have got the simplest way of living a beautiful life.

Mostly people get messed up with the ways of living. Some get excited in the name of culture and some show off their knowledge by explaining beautiful sayings of great philosophers . People, who talks about culture, emphasizes on the orthodox rituals and forgets about the bad things that these rituals has given us in our legacy. So many beliefs are present which can depressed a person . Absolute opposite to it, some people favours the way of full freedom just for the sake of mind and it is accepted as a status symbol.

People have tendency to research on mind. Their most loving work is to find out the most satisfying condition of their mind. If you ever noticed it that if joy is provided to it in a great amount, then it feels unsatisfaction and emptiness more. Due to excess of joy and pleasures people feel more unsatisfied and they get attracted towards philosophy. But here, they get only hollowness in the name of dharm and spirituality.

None has the right way of living life after all kinds of research work. freedom of thoughts is there, what else is needed for visionaries? After researching different aspects of their mind, they present their incomplete thoughts (nonsense) in front of all . Between all these thoughts, simple life wishing people are confused so badly, that their miserable condition can be seen all around.

""PARAM DHARM"" has entered in this earth for directing people the supreme way of prosperous living. ""PARAM DHARM"" is not just a book written by thoughts evolved in mind, but it is a 'granth' scripted in the state of ecstacy (samaadhi). Therefore there is not any kind of trap of thoughts. ""PARAM DHARM"" is so simple that even a ten years old child can also understand it by listening its 'paath'.",NA

It proposes a new hypothesis that borders science and imagination. This work is a serious confluence of physics, philosophy, metaphysic. Theosophy and theology written with a pen, which is youthful and bubbly. Jampak Zu, the virtual cartoon character who has co-authored this book with Kartikey is an innovation in itself. The work brings out seven levels of reality that constitute the cosmic existence. Human existence participates in all of them. It lists the seven important parameters of reality and establishes a canonical inter-relationship between them all. Laws of physics are then extrapolated into the realm of non-physical world using these inter-parametric relations. The seven parameters work like seven interconnected knobs. By turning their values, the reader is made to undergo a journey from one world to another. At the climax of analysis, the reader finds himself in the world of God. The ultimate reality reveals itself automatically and spontaneously with a pleasant surprise that even God does not violate the laws of physics. We see Him through the lens of physics.

In The World Without Us, Alan Weisman offers an utterly original approach to questions of humanity's impact on the planet: he asks us to envision our Earth, without us. In this far-reaching narrative, Weisman explains how our massive infrastructure would collapse and finally vanish without human presence; which everyday items may become immortalized as fossils; how copper pipes and wiring would be crushed into mere seams of reddish rock; why some of our earliest buildings might be the last architecture left; and how plastic, bronze sculpture, radio waves, and some man-made molecules may be our most lasting gifts to the universe.

The World Without Us reveals how, just days after humans disappear, floods in New York's subways would start eroding the city's foundations, and how, as the world's cities crumble, asphalt jungles would give way to real ones. It describes the distinct ways that organic and chemically treated farms would revert to wild, how billions more birds would flourish, and how cockroaches in unheated cities would perish without us. Drawing on the expertise of engineers, atmospheric scientists, art conservators, zoologists, oil refiners, marine biologists, astrophysicists, religious leaders from rabbis to the Dalai Lama, and paleontologistsâwho describe a prehuman world inhabited by megafauna like giant sloths that stood taller than mammothsâWeisman illustrates what the planet might be like today, if not for us.

From places already devoid of humans (a last fragment of primeval European forest; the Korean DMZ; Chernobyl), Weisman reveals Earth's tremendous capacity for self-healing. As he shows which human devastations are indelible, and which examples of our highest art and culture would endure longest, Weisman's narrative ultimately drives toward a radical but persuasive solution that needn't depend on our demise. It is narrative nonfiction at its finest, and in posing an irresistible concept with both gravity and a highly readable touch, it looks deeply at our effects on the planet in a way that no other book has.",non-fiction

Like us, honeybees represent a pinnacle of animal sociality. How they submerge individual needs into the colony collective provides a lens through which to ponder human societies. Winston explains how bees process information, structure work, and communicate, and examines how corporate boardrooms are using bee societies as a model to improve collaboration. He investigates how bees have altered our understanding of agricultural ecosystems and how urban planners are looking to bees in designing more nature-friendly cities.

The relationship between bees and people has not always been benign. Bee populations are diminishing due to human impact, and we cannot afford to ignore what the demise of bees tells us about our own tenuous affiliation with nature. Toxic interactions between pesticides and bee diseases have been particularly harmful, foreshadowing similar effects of pesticides on human health. There is much to learn from bees in how they respond to these challenges. In sustaining their societies, bees teach us ways to sustain our own.""",non-fiction

The first new Ginsberg collection in over fifteen years, Wait Till Iâm Dead is a landmark publication, edited by renowned Ginsberg scholar Bill Morgan and introduced by award-winning poet and Ginsberg enthusiast Rachel Zucker. Ginsberg wrote incessantly for more than fifty years, often composing poetry on demand, and many of the poems collected in this volume were scribbled in letters or sent off to obscure publications and unjustly forgotten. Wait Till Iâm Dead, which spans the whole of Ginsbergâs long writing career, from the 1940s to the 1990s, is a testament to Ginsbergâs astonishing writing and singular aesthetics.

Following the chronology of his life, Wait Till Iâm Dead reproduces the poems together with extensive notes. Containing 104 previously uncollected poems and accompanied by original photographs, Wait Till Iâm Dead is the final major contribution to Ginsbergâs sprawling oeuvre, a must-read for Ginsberg neophytes and longtime fans alike.",poetry

Simon Sinekâs book explains what it is that those apparently born leaders do that makes them so successful. He explains how leaders are not necessarily born; that they can be made. Sinek reveals how any of us can learn what the worldâs âbornâ leaders do that most people donât. This is a âmust readâ book for anyone who wants to lead their organization to success.

What is the great secret that puts one person or organization way out in front of the rest? How do they get to be so much more innovative and successful and remain so, whatever their competitors do? Well, the answer is that asking questions is a good start but they have to be the right questions. Sinek tells us that the most vital question is âWHY.â

In business, it is obviously a good idea to know what you do. You need to know how you do it. But most important of all is to know WHY you do what you do. In âStart with Why,â the author explains that itâs the basic question all the great leaders in business, social reform, or any other field asked themselves right at the beginning. He examines such leaders as Steve Jobs, Richard Branson or Martin Luther King and notes that they all applied the same thinking and started from the same question:âWHY?â

The book goes on to show us how to apply this principle in our own businesses. It explains how to get from âwhat?â to âhow?â and on to âWHY?â Why are we doing what we do rather than something else? Read the book, apply its lessons and you could be the next Jobs or Branson. The skyâs no longer the limit!

When Melisande Stokes, an expert in linguistics and languages, acciden From bestselling author Neal Stephenson and critically acclaimed historical and contemporary commercial novelist Nicole Galland comes a captivating and complex near-future thriller combining history, science, magic, mystery, intrigue, and adventure that questions the very foundations of the modern world.

When Melisande Stokes, an expert in linguistics and languages, accidently meets military intelligence operator Tristan Lyons in a hallway at Harvard University, it is the beginning of a chain of events that will alter their lives and human history itself. The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: she must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money.

Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at Londonâs Crystal Palaceâthe worldâs fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world ""jams"" the ""frequencies"" used by magic, and itâs up to Tristan to find out why.

And so the Department of Diachronic OperationsâD.O.D.O. âgets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back, and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive . . . and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurialâand treacherousânature of the human heart.

Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephensonâs work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Gallandâs storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible, and take you to placesâand timesâbeyond imagining.",science-fiction

In a narrative that spans decades and sees family life through the eyes of each member, A Place For Us charts the crucial moments in the family's past, from the bonds that bring them together to the differences that pull them apart.

The poetâs selection of beautiful images creates a distant land of aesthetic pleasure. It is divided into three parts; Memories, Longing and Confessions. Each part contains a number of poems. The spontaneous outpouring of nostalgia defines the general tenor of the poems contained in the first section, Memories. The deep sense of loss of the sweet and happy days spent in the communion of Nature as well as in the company of the beloved ones characterizes the recurring theme of the Memories. The pang of grief and agony keeps haunting the very psyche of the poet and a nice piece of poetry emerges out of it. The second section, Longing, too, expresses the poetâs sense of personal loss of romantic love. He feels agonized when he finds that he is not one with his beloved. Some undefined powers have set them apart to suffer the trauma. But still he finds solace in the world of his own imagination.

At the age of nineteen, Lara Prior-Palmer discovered a website devoted to âthe worldâs longest, toughest horse raceââan annual competition of endurance and skill that involves dozens of riders racing a series of twenty-five wild ponies across 1,000 kilometers of Mongolian grassland. On a whim, she decided to enter the race. As she boarded a plane to East Asia, she was utterly unprepared for what awaited her.

Riders often spend years preparing to compete in the Mongol Derby, a course that recreates the horse messenger system developed by Genghis Khan, and many fail to finish. Prior-Palmer had no formal training. She was driven by her own restlessness, stubbornness, and a lifelong love of horses. She raced for ten days through extreme heat and terrifying storms, catching a few hours of sleep where she could at the homes of nomadic families.

Battling bouts of illness and dehydration, exhaustion and bruising falls, she decided she had nothing to lose. Each dawn she rode out again on a fresh horse, scrambling up mountains, swimming through rivers, crossing woodlands and wetlands, arid dunes and open steppe, as American television crews chased her in their Jeeps.

This is a book about betrayal of the young, who have no power to defend themselves. It is not intended to make readers comfortable.""
Over the past several years, Jonathan Kozol has visited nearly 60 public schools. Virtually everywhere, he finds that conditions have grown worse for inner-city children in the 15 years since federal courts began dismantling the landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. First, a state of nearly absolute apartheid now prevails in thousands of our schools. The segregation of black children has reverted to a level that the nation has not seen since 1968. Few of the students in these schools know white children any longer. Second, a protomilitary form of discipline has now emerged, modeled on stick-and-carrot methods of behavioral control traditionally used in prisons but targeted exclusively at black and Hispanic children. And third, as high-stakes testing takes on pathological and punitive dimensions, liberal education in our inner-city schools has been increasingly replaced by culturally barren and robotic methods of instruction that would be rejected out of hand by schools that serve the mainstream of society.
Filled with the passionate voices of children and their teachers and some of the most revered and trusted leaders in the black community, ""The Shame of the Nation"" is a triumph of firsthand reporting that pays tribute to those undefeated educators who persist against the odds, but directly challenges the chilling practices now being forced upon our urban systems by the Bush administration. In their place, Kozol offers a humane, dramatic challenge to our nation to fulfill at last the promise made some 50 years ago to all our youngest citizens. From ""The Shame of the Nation""
""I went to Washington to challenge the soft bigotry of low expectations,"" the president said in his campaign for reelection in September 2004. ""It's working. It's making a difference."" It is one of those deadly lies, which, by sheer repetition, is at length accepted by large numbers of Americans as, perhaps, a rough approximation of the truth. But it is not the truth, and it is not an innocent misstatement of the facts. It is a devious appeasement of the heartache of the parents of the poor and, if it is not forcefully resisted and denounced, it is going to lead our nation even further in a perilous direction.

But now, eleven years later, Gina Petri, Petrivilleâs founder, assigns a mate to each youth. When Cassidy refuses to participate in this forced mating, her dissent places her and her family in Ginaâs firing line. This becomes especially pertinent when Cassidy enters a communication pod and meets an alluring hologram. Eric isnât in Petriville and he insists Gina will murder his people if she discovers their existence, because he is one of Earthâs few survivors.

The more Cassidy gets to know Eric, the more sheâs drawn to himâand the feeling seems mutual. He has lost so much in his life and her compassion for him runs deep. Despite the intensity of the static electricity when Cassidy and the hologram of Eric touch, she yearns for the day when she will meet him in person.

With characteristic critical fervor and sure-eyed insight, Hughes brings us the story of an artist whose life and work bridged the transition from the eighteenth-century reign of the old masters to the early days of the nineteenth-century moderns.

With his salient passion for the artist and the art, Hughes brings Goya vividly to life through dazzling analysis of a vast breadth of his work. Building upon the historical evidence that exists, Hughes tracks Goya s development, as man and artist, without missing a beat, from the early works commissioned by the Church, through his long, productive, and tempestuous career at court, to the darkly sinister and cryptic work he did at the end of his life.

In a work that is at once interpretive biography and cultural epic, Hughes grounds Goya firmly in the context of his time, taking us on a wild romp through Spanish history; from the brutality and easy violence of street life to the fiery terrors of the Holy Inquisition to the grave realities of war, Hughes shows us in vibrant detail the cultural forces that shaped Goya s work.

Underlying the exhaustive, critical analysis and the rich historical background is Hughes s own intimately personal relationship to his subject. This is a book informed not only by lifelong love and study, but by his own recent experiences of mortality and death. As such this is a uniquely moving and human book; with the same relentless and fearless intelligence he has brought to every subject he has ever tackled, Hughes here transcends biography to bring us a rich and fiercely brave book about art and life, love and rage, impotence and death. This is one genius writing at full capacity about another and the result is truly spectacular.",art

PRANKS. OIL. PROTEST. JOKES BETWEEN NEWLYWEDS.

AND ONE HILARIOUS SIEGE OF A MAJOR CORPORATION.

Remmy grows up with Beth in Bellhammer, Illinois as oil and coal companies rob the land of everything that made it paradise. Under his Grandad, he learns how to properly prank his neighbors, friends, and foes. Beth tries to fix Remmy by taking him to church. Under his Daddy, Remmy starts the Bell Hammer Construction Company, which depends on contracts from Texarco Oil. And Beth argues with him about how to build a better business. Together, Remmy and Beth start to build a great neighborhood of ""merry men"" carpenters: a paradise of sâmores, porch furniture, newborn babies, and summer trips to Branson where their boys pop the tops off of the neighborhoodâs two hundred soda bottles. Their witty banter builds a kind of castle among a growing nostalgia.

Then one of Jim Johnstoneâs faulty Texarco oil derricks falls down on their house and poisons their neighborhood's well.

Poisoned wells escalate to torched dog houses. Torched dog houses escalate to stolen carpentry tools and cancelled contracts. Cancelled contracts escalate to eminent domain. Sick of the attacks from Texaco Oil on his neighborhood, Remmy assembles his merry men:

Japan was going to dominate, then China.

Countries were called âtigersâ or âmini-dragons,â and were seen as not just development prodigies, but as a unified bloc, culturally and economically similar, and inexorably on the rise.

Joe Studwell has spent two decades as a reporter in the region, and The Financial Times said he âshould be named chief myth-buster for Asian business.â In How Asia Works, Studwell distills his extensive research into the economies of nine countriesâJapan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Chinaâinto an accessible, readable narrative that debunks Western misconceptions, shows what really happened in Asia and why, and for once makes clear why some countries have boomed while others have languished.

Studwellâs in-depth analysis focuses on three main areas: land policy, manufacturing, and finance. Land reform has been essential to the success of Asian economies, giving a kick start to development by utilizing a large workforce and providing capital for growth. With manufacturing, industrial development alone is not sufficient, Studwell argues. Instead, countries need âexport discipline,â a government that forces companies to compete on the global scale. And in finance, effective regulation is essential for fostering, and sustaining growth. To explore all of these subjects, Studwell journeys far and wide, drawing on fascinating examples from a Philippine sugar baronâs stifling of reform to the explosive growth at a Korean steel mill.

Thoroughly researched and impressive in scope, How Asia Works is essential reading for anyone interested in the development of these dynamic countries, a region that will shape the future of the world.",economics

In many respects, War in a Time of Peace serves as a sequel to his classic The Best and the Brightest in its examination of how the lessons of Vietnam have influenced American foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. Beginning with the Persian Gulf War, Halberstam discusses the political shift in emphasis from foreign to domestic issues that ushered in the first Clinton administration. Despite the fact that Clinton, along with much of the country, preferred to focus on the home front, the U.S. nonetheless found itself drawn into conflicts in Haiti, Somalia, and the Balkans--events that reflected American discomfort with the use of its military forces abroad while at the same time acknowledging that much of the world is dependent upon the U.S. for both guidance and support. The book also highlights the many nonpolitical factors that have influenced these political changes, including a generational shift in national leadership, the modern media's emphasis on entertainment over foreign news, a leap in military technology, and American economic prosperity that has rendered foreign policy largely irrelevant to many citizens.
Halberstam is a master at presenting well-rounded portraits and telling anecdotes of the personalities that have created U.S. policy, casting new light on well-known figures such as Clinton, Colin Powell, and George H.W. Bush, as well as supporting players such as Anthony Lake, Richard Holbrooke, James Baker, Madeleine Albright, General Wesley Clark, Al Gore, and many other influential American leaders of the past decade. Having covered many aspects of American history and foreign policy since the early 1960s, Halberstam is uniquely qualified to report on an era in which the U.S., and the world, has changed so dramatically. --Shawn Carkonen",history

Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.

In Deep Work, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four ""rules,"" for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.

A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, Deep Work takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored.

When Caroline boarded the plane to Virginia to move across the country for her new job she never expected to be seated next to the hottest guy sheâd ever seen. She also never expected heâd be so easy to talk to. She knew heâd never be interested in talking to her if he hadnât been trapped in the seat next to her, but it was a nice way to spend a long plane ride.

Neither Wolf nor Caroline were prepared for a terrorist hijacking of their plane, but if Caroline thought that would be the last time sheâd see, or need, Wolf, sheâd be sorely mistaken.

The last of the Richard Bachman novels, recently recovered and published for the first time. Stephen King's ""dark half"" may have saved the best for last.

A fellow named Richard Bachman wrote Blaze in 1973 on an Olivetti typewriter, then turned the machine over to Stephen King, who used it to write Carrie. Bachman died in 1985 (""cancer of the pseudonym""), but in late 2006 King found the original typescript of Blaze among his papers at the University of Maine's Fogler Library (""How did this get here?!""), and decided that with a little revision it ought to be published.

Blaze is the story of Clayton Blaisdell, Jr. --of the crimes committed against him and the crimes he commits, including his last, the kidnapping of a baby heir worth millions. Blaze has been a slow thinker since childhood, when his father threw him down the stairs--and then threw him down again. After escaping an abusive institution for boys when he was a teenager, Blaze hooks up with George, a seasoned criminal who thinks he has all the answers. But then George is killed, and Blaze, though haunted by his partner, is on his own.

He becomes one of the most sympathetic criminals of all of literature. This is a crime story of surprising strength and sadness, with a suspenseful current sustained by the classic workings of fate and character--as taut and riveting as Stephen King's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.",horror

In Healing Through the Shadow of Loss Deborah Morris Coryell describes grief as the experience of not having anywhere to place our love, of losing a connection, an outlet for our emotion. To heal grief we have to learn how to continue to love in the face of loss. Embracing loss allows us to awaken our most profound connections to other people.

Part of the grieving process is finding our place in the world again following a loss. We tend to define ourselves in relation to those we love--as âLauraâs mother,â âJimâs wife,â or âStaceyâs friend.â The loss of a loved one is jarring to these foundations and can make us question our own sense of reality. In addition, the body must adjust to the sensory changes of having lost a part of our life, a part of our daily existence. Coryell draws attention to our societyâs tendency to rank losses in a âhierarchy of grief.â She reminds us that all losses must be grieved in their own right and on their own terms, and that we must honor the âbigâ losses as well as the âsmallâ ones. Paying attention to even the most minute experiences of loss can help us to be more in tune with our responses to the greater ones, allowing us to once again become part of the rhythm of life from which we have become disconnected.",NA

Schulte's work lays bare the economic realities of the Warsaw pact countries and highlights their underlying dependence on trade with the capitalist West. In all this the renowned economic strength of the Federal Republic of Germany from Adenauer to Kohl was a factor of the highest importance. Ultimately the economy of the rival German Democratic Republic was dependent upon both the formal political and the behind-the scenes economic arrangements made between the leaders of West German industries, particularly automobile concerns, and their communist counterparts.

Schwierige Geburt eines deutsch-deutschen Automobildeals.
Der Autor, ein Hamburger Sozial- und Wirtschaftshistoriker, erhielt 1986 das Angebot, einen Film zum Thema ""100 Jahre Geschichte der deutschen Automobilindustrie"" produzieren. Er versuchte an die in sÃ¤chsischen Archiven lagerten Akten der Auto Union heranzukommen und scheiterte. Zehn Jahre spÃ¤ter beantragte Schulte bei der Gauck-BehÃ¶rende ein Forschungsprojekt, welches die Beziehungen zwischen der west- und der ostdeutschen Autoindustrie zum Gegenstand hatte.
Zwischen 1996 und 2003 hat der Autor intensiv in die Akten der MfS-Hauptabteilung XVIII ""Volkswirtschaft"" studiert und aus dem Wust von Unterlagen wesentliche Informationen zu den Beziehungen zwischen westdeutschen Konzernen und ostdeutschen Partei- und Regierungsstellen herausgefiltert. Dabei stieÃ er auch auf die Akten des IM ""Stuck"", eines Autoenthusiasten und Historikers von der Technischen UniversitÃ¤t Dresden, der sich wegen einer zeitweiligen Ausreise in den Westen im Jahre 1957 unter Beobachtung des MfS befand und 1974 wegen unerlaubter Publikation eines Textes zur Automobilgeschichte in einer westdeutschen Zeitschrift (Verletzung von Â§ 100 des Strafgesetzbuches der DDR) âzur informellen Zusammenarbeit mit dem MfS verpflichtet"" wurde. ""Stucks"" Ruf als Automobilhistoriker nutzend, setzte ihn das MfS auf leitende Mitarbeiter des Volkswagenkonzerns an. ""Stuck"" war in diesem Sinne bis 1989 tÃ¤tig. Der ganze Vorgang ist bei Schulte ausfÃ¼hrlich dokumentiert und kommentiert.
Im Mittelpunkt des Buches steht das nach mehrjÃ¤hrigen Verhandlungen 1987 zustande gekommene MotorengeschÃ¤ft mit der Volkswagen AG. VW lieferte die kompletten Fertigungsanlagen fÃ¼r einen Viertaktmotor mit einer JahreskapazitÃ¤t von 290.000 Einheiten.

Story Behind the Book

""The Christy Miller series was actually born when a group of thirteen-year-olds challenged me to write a novel. I'd been questioning the content of their favorite books when they said, 'Why don't you write a book for us?' I told them no, I only wrote picture books. But they persisted: 'How hard could it be? We'll even tell you what to write! We want a love story with teenagers at the beach.' And there you go. Summer Promise first released seventeen years ago and is now translated into five languages. I continue to hear from readers all over the world, many girls saying that they gave their life to Christ after reading Summer Promise. I love that!""

Most people who had close encounters reported that they first heard or detected the rolling calves by their loud chiming and rather unnerving clanking noise. This familiar sound was made by the long chain that they dragged along behind them. They have large red eyes like a dragon's. Some even said that they could breathe fire through their mouths. Some said that the rolling calves were the spirits of evil butchers who had been cruel and mean when they were alive. The best way, they said, to get away from these monstrous beasts was to drop various things on the ground. This storybook was written in an exciting island-style manner. It is about Essie's kids on the island of Jamaica and their unusual encounter with a rolling calf. This is the first of a five part series. The story is continuous. The whole series should be read in order to truly see and understand the full picture that the authors are trying to illustrate. Along with the ability of this black and white picture-book to be used as a coloring-book, there is also a drawing/note pad at the end of each book that allows the reader to draw or demonstrate their own personal illustration of the story after completing the book. Finally, these books also end uniquely always with a strong moral story. 'When it dawned on Karl that his pursuer was most likely to be a rolling calf, he really started running as if he hadn't been running before. He forgot about his damaged toe. He forgot about running and hopping. He was now running full, top speed, Carl Lewis or Asafa Powell style. He was all-out straight sprinting. He shifted into sixth gear and took off blazing the trail for his dear life. Neither Usain Bolt nor Michael Johnson nor any other athlete or track and field star could have kept up with Karl that night. He was sure that he must have broken some kind of world record.

If there were speed limits for the sheer pulse-racing excitement allowed in one novel, ""Velocity"" would break them all. Get ready for the ride of your life.

Bill Wiles is an easygoing, hardworking guy who leads a quiet, ordinary life. But that is about to change. One evening, after his usual eight-hour bartending shift, he finds a typewritten note under the windshield wiper of his car.


""If you don't take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher. If you do take this note to the police, I will instead kill an elderly woman active in charity work. You have four hours to decide. The choice is yours.""


It seems like a sick joke, and Bill's friend on the police force, Lanny Olson, thinks so too. His advice to Bill is to go home and forget about it. Besides, what could they do even if they took the note seriously? No crime has actually been committed. But less than twenty-four hours later, a young blond schoolteacher is found murdered, and it's Bill's fault: he didn't convince the police to get involved. Now he's got another note, another deadline, another ultimatum...and two new lives hanging in the balance.

Suddenly Bill's average, seemingly innocuous life takes on the dimensions and speed of an accelerating nightmare. Because the notes are coming faster, the deadlines growing tighter, and the killer becoming bolder and crueler with every communication--until Bill is isolated with the terrifying knowledge that he alone has the power of life and death over a psychopath's innocent victims. Until the struggle between good and evil is intensely personal. Until the most chilling words of all are: ""The choice is yours.""",horror

Having discussed grace in theological terms, Zahl goes on to address the practicality of grace, developing a systematic theology of grace that is radically understood from the Bible and consistently applied to everyday life. After helpfully narrowing down specific fields of grace, asserting throughout that grace always trumps both law and church, Zahl concludes with an expanded view of grace in everything, extending this good news to all creation.",religion

Our scientists have produced landmark studies on the dangers of DDT, tobacco smoke, acid rain, and global warming. But at the same time, a small yet potent subset of this community leads the world in vehement denial of these dangers.

Merchants of Doubt tells the story of how a loose-knit group of high-level scientists and scientific advisers, with deep connections in politics and industry, ran effective campaigns to mislead the public and deny well-established scientific knowledge over four decades. Remarkably, the same individuals surface repeatedlyâsome of the same figures who have claimed that the science of global warming is ""not settled"" denied the truth of studies linking smoking to lung cancer, coal smoke to acid rain, and CFCs to the ozone hole.

This volume translates into English for the first time his book The Russian Folktale, which was based on a seminar on Russian folktales that Propp taught at Leningrad State University late in his life. Edited and translated by Sibelan Forrester, this English edition contains Propp's own text and is supplemented by notes from his students.

The Russian Folktale begins with Propp's description of the folktale's aesthetic qualities and the history of the term; the history of folklore studies, first in Western Europe and then in Russia and the USSR; and the place of the folktale in the matrix of folk culture and folk oral creativity. The book presents Propp's key insight into the formulaic structure of Russian wonder tales (and less schematically than in Morphology, though in abbreviated form), and it devotes one chapter to each of the main types of Russian folktales: the wonder tale, the ""novellistic"" or everyday tale, the animal tale, and the cumulative tale. Even Propp's bibliography, included here, gives useful insight into the sources accessible to and used by Soviet scholars in the third quarter of the twentieth century.

Propp's scholarly authority and his human warmth both emerge from this well-balanced and carefully structured series of lectures. An accessible introduction to the Russian folktale, it will serve readers interested in folklore and fairy-tale studies in addition to Russian history and cultural studies.",folklore

James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Kahir un-Nissaâ'Most excellent among Women'âthe great-niece of the Nizam's Prim White Mughals is the romantic and ultimately tragic tale of a passionate love affair that crossed and transcended all the cultural, religious and political boundaries of its time. James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Kahir un-Nissaâ'Most excellent among Women'âthe great-niece of the Nizam's Prime Minister and a descendant of the Prophet. Kirkpatrick had gone out to India as an ambitious soldier in the army of the East India Company, eager to make his name in the conquest and subjection of the subcontinent. Instead, he fell in love with Khair and overcame many obstacles to marry herânot least of which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to Islam, and according to Indian sources even became a double-agent working for the Hyderabadis against the East India Company.

It is a remarkable story, involving secret assignations, court intrigue, harem politics, religious and family disputes. But such things were not unknown; from the early sixteenth century, when the Inquisition banned the Portuguese in Goa from wearing the dhoti, to the eve of the Indian mutiny, the 'white Mughals' who wore local dress and adopted Indian ways were a source of embarrassments to successive colonial administrations. William Dalrymple unearths such colourful figures as 'Hindoo Stuart', who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and who spent many years trying to persuade the memsahibs of Calcutta to adopt the sari; and Sir David Ochterlony, Kirkpatrick's counterpart in Delhi, who took all thirteen of his wives out for evening promenades, each on the back of their own elephant.

In White Mughals, William Dalrymple discovers a world almost entirely unexplored by history, and places at its centre a compelling tale of love, seduction and betrayal. It possesses all the sweep and resonance of a great nineteenth-century novel, set against a background of shifting alliances and the manoeuvring of the great powers, the mercantile ambitions of the British and the imperial dreams of Napoleon. White Mughals, the product of five years' writing and research, triumphantly confirms Dalrymple's reputation as one of the finest writers at work today.",history

In pieces ranging in length from a mere paragraph to several pages, Atwood gives a sly pep talk to the ambitious young; writes about the disconcerting experience of looking at old photos of ourselves; gives us Horatio's real views on Hamlet; and examines the boons and banes of orphanhood. Bring Back Mom: An Invocation; explores what life was really like for the ""perfect"" homemakers of days gone by, and in The Animals Reject Their Names she runs history backward, with surprising results.

When activist Robert Sartorius, leading a global campaign to create a European Parliament-style world-wide United Nations Parliamentary Assembly presses the proposal in New York on his old friend the UN Secretary-General and is rebuffed due to the hostile pressure of the conservative American administration, his Committee resolves to fight back by launching a celebrity-driven Bono-Geldof-Band Aid/Live 8-style âPeople Powerâ media campaign and telethon spearheaded by rock superstars Isis and Osiris and former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to mobilize global public support and pressure in alliance with the Occupy Wall Street Movements worldwide. The Blogs of Sartorius, activist Eva Strong and Committee Chairman Andreas Sarkozy reveal the campaignâs working struggle, their tangled love affairs, a loss of faith, attempted suicide, reconciliation of father and son after divorce, and recovery of personal love and faith.


Things fall apart as the idealistsâ global crusade is infiltrated by a cell of jihadist terrorists using it as a cover, then counter-infiltrated by CIA agent Jack McKinsey and British MI6 agent Etienne Dearlove. A cat-and-mouse game of espionage and intrigue ensues pitting them against the Chinese MSS espionage network allied with the Iranian Quds Force crossing Beijing, London, Moscow, Washington and Jerusalem unleashing an uncontrollable series of events which sees the American Olympic Track and Field Team bombed on an airplane in London, uncovers a secret conspiracy of China, Russia and Iran to jointly seize the oil reserves of the Middle-East, and witnesses Presidents Clinton and Carter taken hostage with Sartorius, McKinsey, Eva and other activists at a Jerusalem telethon rally cut short by the explosion of a concealed atomic device in a loaned Chinese Terracotta Warrior, then flown by capturing terrorists to Qom, Iran as âhuman shieldsâ to deter a retaliatory nuclear attack.


In Book II, Spiritus Mundi, the Romance they encounter Iranâs Supreme Leader in Qom as the world teeters on the brink of nuclear confrontation and World War III, while mysterious events unfold leading Sartorius and McKinsey from their captivity in the underground nuclear facilities of Qom into a hidden neo-mythic dimension that takes them to a vast ocean and land at the center of the world, Middle Earth, Inner Shambhala, and to involvement in a mysterious Castalian âCrystal Bead Gameâ linked to the destiny of the human race on earth. They then embark on a quest for the Silmaril, or Missing Seed Crystal to the central island of Omphalos in the Great Central Sea in the middle of the globe, aided by Goethe, the Chinese Monkey King, Captain Nemo, the African God-Hero Ogun, and a Sufi mystic they traverse a âwormholeâ at the center of the earth guarded by âThe Mothersâ and the fallen angel tribe of the Grigori (Genesis 6:1-4) which leads the way to critical meeting of the âCouncil of the Immortalsâ at the Black Hole in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy to determine the final fate of the human species. The heroes battle and overcome the treacherous opposition of Mephisto and his satanic subaltern Mundus through their Underworld and Otherworld adventures and successfully plead the cause of the continuation of the human species before the Immortals, returning with the critical Silmaril Crystal, resolving the Crystal Bead Game and thereby inspiring through the Archangel Gabriel a dream in the mind of Iranâs Supreme Leader which brings a new Revelation causing him to release the hostages and an end the crisis. China and Russia stand down from aiding Iran in seizing the Mid-East oil reserves, but in a treacherous blow the Chinese instead utilize their forward-positioned armies to attack their former ally Russia and seize Siberia with its large oil and gas reserves instead. President Barret Osama, Americaâs newly-elected first black President then invites Russia, Japan and South Korea to join NATO and together they succeed in expelling the Chinese from Siberia and usher in a new Eurasian and global balance of power and a New World Order.
Rock Superstar Osiris meanwhile, after undertaking a narcissistic Messianic mission in the wake of the Jerusalem atomic blast is dramatically assassinated on live world-wide television on Jerusalemâs Via Dolorosa by a disillusioned follower. His wife and rock-star partner Isis then leads a spiritual movement to reconcile and unite the clashing religions and catalyze a common global spiritual Renaissance through a Global Progressive Spiritual Alliance which seeks to construct an Inter-faith Temple on the ruins of the atomic blast in Jerusalem. In counter-reaction to the cataclysmic events the world finally implements Sartoriusâ crusade for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, but not before Sartorius has himself has died, Moses-like of a heart attack while helping to foil a metaconspiracy mediated by Time Travel in which a fascist agent from the 23rd Century who has time-transited back to our time to alter a benign history by causing WWIII and thus preventing the evolution of a democratic world government, the United States of Earth, which follows him through time and nabs him just in the ânick of timeâ to prevent Aramgeddon. The book ends with the opening ceremony of the UN Parliamentary Assembly which is attended in Sartoriusâ name by his widow Eva Strong, whom Sartorius had fallen in love with and married in the course of the novel, and by their son Euphy, newborn after Sartoriusâ death. They are joined in cinematic climax at the ceremony by newly chosen UN Secretary-General Clinton, President Osama and UN Parliamentary Assembly Committee Chairman Andreas Sarkozy who have just received the Nobel Peace Prize for their work in creation of the worldâs first world parliamentary assembly within the United Nations, bringing together the representative voices of the peoples of the world in face-to-face assembly and dialogue for the first time in world history.

He's examined multiple layers of personality in his characters; male, female, Chinese, Arab, English, and American melding them into a story of possible outcomes.

It contains also significant discussions of World Literature, including Chinese, Indian, Western and American literature, and like Joyce's Ulysses, it incorporates a vast array of stylistic approaches as the story unfolds. Book II, Spiritus Mundi the Romance, dilates the setting, scope and continuing action as a Romance of fantasy adventure where the protagonists, still following the original action of Book I, embark on a quest to the realms of Middle Earth and its Crystal Bead Game in search of the Silmaril Missing Seed Crystal and thence through a wormhole to a ""Council of the Immortals"" in an Amphitheater in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy to plead for the continuance of the human race in the face of threatened extinction from a nuclear World War III involving the confrontation and military showdown between NATO, China, Russia and Iran unfolded from the espionage events of Book I. The contemporary epic culminates with the first convening of the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, a world-scale version of the European Parliament installed as a new organ of the United Nations.

But as we moved towards modern times, we lost many things which matter the most. We have lost the way of our lives with no one to show us the light. All our education and knowledge revolve around making a living. But though it may be potent to tell us how to make a living, it fails to impart us the knowledge of how to live. Moreover, we seldom find any time to read any books concerning matters outside our vocational realm.

âThe Sojournâ is an attempt to fill the gap. In the most succinct yet captivating way, the book opens doors to many truths. It is a journey of not only our lives but the entire universe. By reading the book and totally immersing in it, the reader will find himself in a new dimension. His way of seeing everything will change. The truth, if manipulated, becomes a lie. The more efforts are made to hide it, the more it loses its identity. Therefore, what was always lying before us will be known to us forever. The truth is simple and elegant. Thatâs why it is the truth. By knowing its true nature and essence, we will see everything in its true grandeur.

On including âThe Sojournâ in the curriculums, the students will come to know how to conduct their lives in the most effective way. They will find a guiding light in any situation of their lives. On repeated readings, the book will become a part of their subconscious mind and consequently, their second nature. This will give them a meaning and purpose for their lives. Those who have passed their study phase can read the book and implement the principles in their lives. The book will change their perception and will help them find their purpose. They will find the ways to resolve anything, since they will know the reason and true nature of all the existence.

Thus, âThe Sojournâ is a book that will transform. When read with an open mind, and several times, new thoughts and truths will emerge each time, to ponder over. No matter whatsoever the situation a person may be in; on reading the book with a quiet mind and reflecting upon it, he will find solutions and ways out. With the limited time in our lives, these thirty five pages of poems will become a facilitator in real sense of the word. Therefore, the book is meant for everyone and will make the foundations of all civilizations very strong.

For more than fi Based on eight years of exhaustive research and exclusive interviews with more than 200 peopleâand published in coordination with the international theatrical release of a major documentary film from the Weinstein CompanyâSalinger is a global cultural event: the definitive biography of one of the most beloved and mysterious figures of the twentieth century.
For more than fifty years, the ever elusive author of The Catcher in the Rye has been the subject of a relentless stream of newspaper and magazine articles as well as several biographies. Yet all of these attempts have been hampered by a fundamental lack of access and by the persistent recycling of inaccurate information. Salinger remains, astonishingly, an enigma. The complex and contradictory human being behind the myth has never been revealed.

No longer.

In the eight years since Salinger was begun, and especially in the three years since Salingerâs death, the authors interviewed on five continents more than 200 people, many of whom had previously refused to go on the record about their relationship with Salinger. This oral biography offers direct eyewitness accounts from Salingerâs World War II brothers-in-arms, his family members, his close friends, his lovers, his classmates, his neighbors, his editors, his publishers, his New Yorker colleagues, and people with whom he had relationships that were secret even to his own family. Shields and Salerno illuminate most brightly the last fifty-six years of Salingerâs life: a period that, until now, had remained completely dark to biographers. Provided unprecedented access to never-before-published photographs (more than 100 throughout the book), diaries, letters, legal records, and secret documents, readers will feel they have, for the first time, gotten beyond Salingerâs meticulously built-up wall.

The second edition of this work has included the four early Post-Sanctus prayers that exist within our Liturgy. The full Agnus Dei for use within the Requiem Liturgy has been included. This is a further example of the Romanization of the Ambrosian Liturgy. There has been a general consensus that the Roman blessing at the end of the Liturgy be dropped in favor of the more ancient Ambrosian blessing. The Ambrosian blessing gained greater acceptance over time and it has been now introduced as the official final blessing for Liturgical usage. This blessing is Gallican in its origin and bears a remarkable similarity to the final blessing used within the Liturgy of St John Chrysostom. It is a well known fact that St Ambrose and St John Chrysostom were friends and that the Penitential Litanies we call the Divinae Pacis and the Dicamus Omnes came directly from John to his friend Ambrose. The Creed rightly retains its place after the offertory and does not include the filioque clause thus conforming to the original Nicene Creed. The Liturgy is a lesson in theology. It was Ambrose's good friend Augustine who stated that, ""we pray as we believe"". The heavy Christological emphasis was deliberately placed there against Arianism. In medieval depictions, St Ambrose carries a whip in his hand to fight heresy and to beat down heretics. We pray for St Ambrose's intercession today to help us fight our modern day heresies which attack the Church from all sides.......especially from within. Finally, the Litany for Persecuted Christians has been added to be said after the Liturgy has concluded. This Litany is extra Liturgical and of modern penmanship. St Ambrose, pray for us !!!",NA

Used to tending the sick as they are, nothing could have prepared them for what they confront, first near Gallipoli, then on the Western Front.

Yet amid the carnage, Naomi and Sally Durance become the friends they never were at home and find themselves courageous in the face of extreme danger, as well as the hostility they encounter from some on their own side. There is great bravery, humor, and compassion, too, and the inspiring example of the remarkable women they serve alongside. In France, where Naomi nurses in a hospital set up by the eccentric Lady Tarlton while Sally works in a casualty clearing station, each meets an exceptional man: the kind of men for whom they might give up some of their precious independence â if only they all survive.

At once vast in scope and extraordinarily intimate, The Daughters of Mars brings World War I to vivid, concrete life from an unusual perspective. A searing and profoundly moving tale, it pays tribute to men and women of extraordinary moral resilience, even in the face of the incomprehensible horrors of modern war.",historical

The story-within-a-story melds into a fascinating exploration of past and present lives intertwined, and a sequence of stunning revelations unfolds.

The 2008 Global Financial Crisis is looming, a time of losses for some in Rosettaâs circle, and the odd astonishing gain. Via the path of mystery, reversals in fortunes and romantic love, Rosetta and her book club unwittingly get involved in a quest for The Silvering: an epoch rumoured to begin in 2022. The world's concept of worth, however, is keeping alive a body-king-created cycle of suffering, and the chance for a brighter future is fading fast.

Beneath the red soil of a southern land lies a glimmer of hopeâa legacy of Norwegian forest-dwellersâdestined to bring about a worldwide epiphanyâ¦but only if two people are heartfelt enough to fulfil Lillibridgeâs mystifying prophecy.

Discoveries Matthew makes about Edward Lillibridge in the British village of Tintagel (letters the author wrote to his sister and son) align him with Rosetta and her desire to glean clues, but between them stands a wall of mistrust that threatens the sprites' noble plans. Each letter adds further detail to the tapestry of Lillibridgeâs 18th-century existence, and Matthew is confronted with an uncanny truth that challenges his perceptions of life and death.",NA

You have heard and read books about Mr Lee Kuan Yew (LKY), the 'founding father of Singapore', and impressed with what he did for Singapore. But do you know that without supportive people, there is no way for him to achieve what he did today?

Picture this: During the earlier years, if we were to airdrop LKY to China for him to do what he did for Singapore, what do you think would happen? Well, more likely than not, he would be wiped out by the Cultural Revolution. Or let's airdrop him to America instead. Would he be who he is today? Unlikely, given his character, and in the democratic environment of America, he would be labelled as radical or even extremist and there would be riots every day.

Chinese Art of War believes in the 3-Powers for success: Right Time, Right Place and the Right People. Only when these 3 Powers are in harmony, would one be able to make huge achievements. LKY was a great leader who knew these and used these to his advantages.

You had read how great the timing was for Singapore's independence to coincide with China's Cultural Revolution; you had also read how strategic the location of Singapore is. Now, it is time to look at the 3rd Power - the Right People.

There are many countries full of admiration of LKY and the achievements made by Singapore and hoped to replicate this over to their countries, but they will find it impossible to replicate the recipe because they are lacking in one of the most important ingredients: The People.

This book investigates this ""People Power"" and guides you through the understanding of the Basis Of Singaporean Spirit (BOSS) - Written by the People, for the People. No matter whether you are a leader, commoner, celebrity, philanthropist, rich or poor, there is always something useful for you.

In this book, Basis Of Singaporean Spirit - People Power, the author combined his professional business consulting knowledge, with the vast knowledge of Chinese Wisdom to highlight the criticality of the ""People Power"" and the need for leaders to focus on the basis first - for when the basis is wrong, nothing will be right.

This is not the ordinary leadership book that 'reverse engineered' the success of somebody, and presents it as 'the model that he took'. This is a book on the basis of it all.

You can pay top dollars to employ the so-called 'best and most qualified' people, you can leverage the best methodologies, you can perform the most complex analysis and modelling, but when the basis is wrong, nothing will be right. Getting the ""basis"" right is of utmost importance in anything.

This book is based upon the issues and unhappiness in today's Singapore and extended to the global stage to highlight the basis of the problems. In the book, the author uses different case studies and business analysis to lead the readers down to the basis of it all.

The author also presented a comparison of Logical Analysis vs Statistical Analysis to demystify the credibility of Statistical Analysis. If you want to understand the games that politicians around the World are playing and how you can counter that, you need to read this book.

Throughout the book, the author highlighted key concepts, which he called ""BOSS Wisdom"" to share with the readers. These ""BOSS Wisdom"" are summary concepts that the author hoped readers can ponder over.

The chapter ""Why Do You Want to Go to Heaven?"" was initially written for Singapore. However, during the writing of this book, there were conflicts in the Gaza area. Thus, the author would also like to dedicate this chapter to the People of Israel & Palestine. This chapter will not resolve the conflicts, but the author hoped that the People can remind themselves about the ""3-Powers training ground"" the next time before they fight.",NA
