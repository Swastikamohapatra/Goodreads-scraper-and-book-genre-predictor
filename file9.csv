Inspired by Sigmund Freudâs only visit to America, The Interpretation of Murder is an intricate tale of murder and the mindâs most dangerous mysteries. It unfurls on a sweltering August evening in 1909 as Freud disembarks from the steamship George Washington, accompanied by Carl Jung, his rival and protÃ©gÃ©. Across town, in an opulent apartment high above the city, a stunning young woman is found dangling from a chandelierâwhipped, mutilated, and strangled. The next day, a second beautyâa rebellious heiress who scorns both high society and her less adventurous parentsâbarely escapes the killer. Yet Nora Acton, suffering from hysteria, can recall nothing of her attack. Asked to help her, Dr. Stratham Younger, Americaâs most committed Freudian analyst, calls in his idol, the Master himself, to guide him through the challenges of analyzing this high-spirited young woman whose family past has been as complicated as his own.

The Interpretation of Murder leads readers from the salons of Gramercy Park, through secret passages, to Chinatownâeven far below the currents of the East River where laborers are building the Manhattan Bridge. As Freud fends off a mysterious conspiracy to destroy him, Younger is drawn into an equally thrilling adventure that takes him deep into the subterfuges of the human mind.

Richly satisfying, elegantly crafted, The Interpretation of Murder marks the debut of a brilliant, spectacularly entertaining new storyteller.

Two of the women are unknown to the townspeople, while the third is the long-lost wife of Richard Fong, the handsome manager of the local gambling parlor, who had left her behind in China many years earlier and had not yet returned for her.

Richard's wife's unexpected arrival complicates his life in no small way-not least with two prostitutes at the local brothel he frequents. One, the beautiful young Chloe, depends on him but has eyes for someone else, someone even more forbidden-the local preacher's daughter. The other, Poppy, the psychic madam of the brothel, is desperately in love with him, and she begins to sink into despair as he grows further and further away from her.

As the lives of the townspeople become inextricably intertwined with the newly arrived women, Poppy's premonitions begin to foretell a deep unhappiness for all involved.

He was also a French translator of American hard-boiled crime novels. One of his discoveries was an African-American writer by the name of Vernon Sullivan.

The book is about a 'white Negro' who acts out an act of revenge against a small Southern town, in repayment for the death of his brother, who was lynched by an all white mob. Upon its release, I Spit on Your Graves became a bestseller in France, as well as a instruction manual for a copycat killer whose copy of I Spit on Your Graves was found by the murdered body of a prostitute with certain violent passages underlined. A censorship trail also came up where Sullivan as the author was held responsible for the material.

Simon Winchester has also fashioned an enthralling and informative informative look at the tumultuous subterranean world that produces earthquakes, the planet's most sudden and destructive force.

In the early morning hours of April 18, 1906, San Francisco and a string of towns to its north-northwest and the south-southeast were overcome by an enormous shaking that was compounded by the violent shocks of an earthquake, registering 8.25 on the Richter scale. The quake resulted from a rupture in a part of the San Andreas fault, which lies underneath the earth's surface along the northern coast of California. Lasting little more than a minute, the earthquake wrecked 490 blocks, toppled a total of 25,000 buildings, broke open gas mains, cut off electric power lines throughout the Bay area, and effectively destroyed the gold rush capital that had stood there for a half century.

Perhaps more significant than the tremors and rumbling, which affected a swatch of California more than 200 miles long, were the fires that took over the city for three days, leaving chaos and horror in its wake. The human tragedy included the deaths of upwards of 700 people, with more than 250,000 left homeless. It was perhaps the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States.

Simon WinchesterÂ brings his inimitable storytelling abilities -- as well as his unique understanding of geology -- to this extraordinary event, exploring not only what happened in northern California in 1906 but what we have learned since about the geological underpinnings that caused the earthquake in the first place. But his achievement is even greater: he positions the quake's significance along the earth's geological timeline and shows the effect it had on the rest of twentieth-century California and American history.

A Crack in the Edge of the WorldÂ is the definitive account of the San Francisco earthquake. It is also a fascinating exploration of a legendary event that changed the way we look at the planet on which we live.",history

-- from the Introduction by Peter Conn
In Washington Square (1880), Henry James reminisces about the New York he had known thirty years before as he tells the story of Catherine Sloper and her fortune-seeking suitor Morris Townsend. This perceptively drawn human drama is James' most accessible work and an enduring literary triumph.
Washington Square Press' Enriched Classics present the great works of world literature enhanced for the contemporary reader. This edition of Washington Square has been prepared by Peter Conn, Andrea Mitchell Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania.

This book is the previously untold and epic story of how a political newcomer Before the White House and Air Force One, before the TV ads and the enormous rallies, there was the real Barack Obama: a man wrestling with the momentous decision to run for the presidency, feeling torn about leaving behind a young family, and figuring out how to win the biggest prize in politics.

This book is the previously untold and epic story of how a political newcomer with no money and an alien name grew into the worldâs most powerful leader. But it is also a uniquely intimate portrait of the person behind the iconic posters and the Secret Service code name Renegade.

Drawing on a dozen unplugged interviews with the candidate and president, as well as twenty-one months covering his campaign as it traveled from coast to coast, Richard Wolffe answers the simple yet enduring question about Barack Obama: Who is he?

Based on Wolffeâs unprecedented access to Obama, Renegade reveals the making of a president, both on the campaign trail and before he ran for high office. It explains how the politician who emerged in an extraordinary election learned the personal and political skills to succeed during his youth and early career. With cool self-discipline, calculated risk taking, and simple storytelling, Obama developed the strategies he would need to survive the onslaught of the Clintons and John McCain, and build a multimillion-dollar machine to win a historic contest.

In Renegade, Richard Wolffe shares with us his front-row seat at Obamaâs announcement to run for president on a frigid day in Springfield, and his victory speech on a warm night in Chicago. We fly on the candidateâs plane and ride in his bus on an odyssey across a country in crisis; stand next to him at a bar on the night he secures the nomination; and are backstage as he delivers his convention speech to a stadium crowd and a transfixed national audience. From a teacherâs office in Iowa to the Oval Office in Washington, we see and hear Barack Obama with an immediacy and honesty never witnessed before.

Renegade provides not only an account of Obamaâs triumphs, but also examines his many personal and political trials. We see Obama wrestling with race and politics, as well as his former pastor Reverend Jeremiah Wright. We see him struggling with life as a presidential candidate, a campaign that falters for most of its first year, and his reaction to a surprise defeat in the New Hampshire primary. And we see him relying on his personal experience, as well as meticulous polling, to pass the presidential test in foreign and economic affairs.

Renegade is an essential guide to understanding President Barack Obama and his trusted inner circle of aides and friends. It is also a riveting and enlightening first draft of history and political psychology.",politics

Hoping to make a dignifiedâand, although he wonât admit it, dramaticâexit from this world, Molinet plots his escape, picking an elegant setting for his suicide via sleeping pills: Moroccoâs LâHirondelle dâOr, one of the most luxurious resorts in the world.

There, he will be able to forget his cares, drape himself in a white caftan, and try to make a little money playing backgammon before he does himself in. The day before his trip, Molinet has a lunch date with his vivacious nieceâwho enthralls him with the story of a scandalous and deeply suspicious death.

Jaime ValdÃ©s, high society lothario, has seemingly choked to death in the presence of both his mistress and his wife, but all of Spain is atwitter with the possibility of murder. Coincidentally, when he arrives at the spa, Molinet realizes that the stylish woman sitting by the pool is none other than ValdÃ©sâs widow. And when a throng of gossipy Europeans arrive on the scene, it quickly becomes clear that despite its air of tranquility, many sinister things are happening at LâHirondelle. Before he knows it, Molinetâs eavesdropping leads to a startling turn of events.

Internationally bestselling author Carmen Posadas has created a corrosive and witty high society whodunit in the vein of Agatha Christieâs Murder on the Orient Express. The Last Resort mixes poolside cocktails and acid-laced gossip with privilege and murder to marvelous effect.

In the final pages of Valhalla Rising, Dirk Pitt discovered, to his shock, that he had two grown children he had never known-twenty-three-year-old fraternal twins born to a woman he thought had died in an underwater earthquake. Both have inherited his love of the sea: the girl, Summer, is a marine biologist; the boy, himself named Dirk, is a marine engineer. And now they are about to help their father in the adventure of a lifetime.

There is a brown tide infesting the ocean off the shore of Nicaragua. The twins are working in a NUMA(r) underwater enclosure, trying to determine its origin, when two startling things happen: Summer discovers an artifact, something strange and beautiful and ancient; and the worst storm in years boils up out of the sky, heading straight not only for them but also for a luxurious floating resort hotel square in its path.

The peril for everybody concerned is incalculable, and, desperately, Pitt, Al Giordino, and the rest of the NUMA(r) crew rush to the rescue, but what they find in the storm's wake makes the furies of nature pale in comparison. For there is an all-too-human evil at work in that part of the world, and the brown tide is only a by-product of its plan. Soon, its work will be complete-and the world will be a very different place.

Though if Summer's discovery is to be believed, the world is already a very different place...",fiction

Jerome's Three Men in a Boat includes an introduction and notes by Jeremy Lewis in Penguin Classics.

Martyrs to hypochondria and general seediness, J. and his friends George and Harris decide that a jaunt up the Thames would suit them to a 'T'. But when they set off, they can hardly predict the troubles that lie ahead with tow-ropes, unreliable weather forecasts and tins of pineapple chunks - not to mention the devastation left in the wake of J.'s small fox-terrier Montmorency. Three Men in a Boat was an instant success when it appeared in 1889, and, with its benign escapism, authorial discursions and wonderful evocation of the late-Victorian 'clerking classes', it hilariously captured the spirit of its age.

In his introduction, Jeremy Lewis examines Jerome K. Jerome's life and times, and the changing world of Victorian England he depicts - from the rise of a new mass-culture of tabloids and bestselling novels to crazes for daytripping and bicycling.",classics

In The Bear and the Dragon, the future is very near at hand indeed.
Newly elected in his own right, Jack Ryan has found that being President has gotten no easier: domestic pitfalls await him at every turn; there's a revolution in Liberia; the Asian economy is going down the tubes; and now, in Moscow, someone may have tried to take out the chairman of the SVR--the former KGB--with a rocket-propelled grenade. Things are unstable enough in Russia without high-level assassination, but even more disturbing may be the identities of the potential assassins. Were they political enemies, the Russian Mafia, or disaffected former KGB? Or, Ryan wonders, is something far more dangerous at work here?
Ryan is right. For even while he dispatches his most trusted eyes and ears, including black ops specialist John Clark, to find out the truth of the matter, forces in China are moving ahead with a plan of truly audacious proportions. If they succeed, the world as we know it will never look the same. If they fail...the consequences will be unspeakable.

So begins The Sacred Bones by Michael Byrnes, a page-turning novel from a new voice on the thriller scene. With the violent theft leaving thirteen Israeli soldiers and policemen dead, and the Palestinians up in arms over the desecration of sacred grounds, the tension between the two groups is dangerously high. Jerusalem is a stick of dynamite and the fuse has been lit. . . .

Across the Mediterranean in Italy, American forensic scientist Charlotte Hennesey has been hired by the Vatican to examine the contents of a newly discovered archeological treasure: a two-thousand-year-old ossuary containing the bones of an unidentified, crucified manâthe first complete skeleton of a crucifixion victim ever found. Together with Italian anthropologist Giovanni Bersei, Charlotte makes startling forensic and genetic discoveries that lead her to wonderâcould these be the bones of Jesus Christ?

With the situation in Jerusalem veering out of control and the malevolent eye of Vatican security expert Salvatore Conte watching her every step, Charlotte puts two and two together. She knows that if the mortal remains of Christ are indeed in the burial box, the implicationsâfor history and science, for religion and the Churchâare frighteningly vast.

On December 10, 1996, Jill Bolte Taylor, a thirty-seven- year-old Harvard-trained brain scientist experienced a massive stroke in the left hemisphere of her brain. As she observed her mind deteriorate to the point that she could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of her life-all within four hours-Taylor alternated between the euphoria of the intuitive and kinesthetic right brain, in which she felt a sense of complete well-being and peace, and the logical, sequential left brain, which recognized she was having a stroke and enabled her to seek help before she was completely lost. It would take her eight years to fully recover.
For Taylor, her stroke was a blessing and a revelation. It taught her that by ""stepping to the right"" of our left brains, we can uncover feelings of well-being that are often sidelined by ""brain chatter.""

For everyone who knew that girl.
For everyone who wondered who that girl was.

Kerry Cohen is eleven years old when she recognizes the power of her body in the leer of a grown man. Her parents are recently divorced and it doesn't take long before their lassitude and Kerry's desire to stand out--to be memorable in some way--combine to lead her down a path she knows she shouldn't take. Kerry wanted attention. She wanted love. But not really understanding what love was, not really knowing how to get it, she reached for sex instead.

Loose Girl is Kerry Cohen's captivating memoir about her descent into promiscuity and how she gradually found her way toward real intimacy. The story of addiction--not just to sex, but to male attention--Loose Girl is also the story of a young girl who came to believe that boys and men could give her life meaning. It didn't matter who he was. It was their movement that mattered, their being together. And for a while, that was enough.

218,Moses in the Hieroglyphs,Grant Berkley,3.56,9,1,NA,0,"Joseph, Moses, Solomon & Sheba
The assertion that there are no ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic texts that make mention of the Hebrew Patriarchs Joseph, Moses, and Solomon and the Queen of Sheba is incorrect. There are unmistakable Hieroglyphic texts. The Nation of Khumry, who are misnamed as the ""Welsh,"" are reliably traced back in time and distance as the ""lost"" Ten Tribes Joseph, Moses, Solomon & Sheba
The assertion that there are no ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic texts that make mention of the Hebrew Patriarchs Joseph, Moses, and Solomon and the Queen of Sheba is incorrect. There are unmistakable Hieroglyphic texts. The Nation of Khumry, who are misnamed as the ""Welsh,"" are reliably traced back in time and distance as the ""lost"" Ten Tribes of Israel. Their deportation from Israel to Armenia around 720 - 700 BC was followed by their march west through Asia Minor to the Dardanelles. Half the Nation went to found Etruria around 650 BC, and the remainder sailed for Britain in c 504 BC. This means that before they arrived in Canaan to found Israel, they were in Egypt. A strange Khumric Triad notation of around 100 years ago indicates the Egyptian connection and specifically refers to the Hieroglyphic writings. The clear inference is that Khumric is the basic language of the Hieroglyphics. Professor Sir John Morris Jones wrote a Thesis in 1898 that demonstrated the identically of the complex Khumric Syntax and that of Ancient Egypt. Plus the fact that the same seven vowels - A E I O U W Y - were used in Ancient Egypt and the Khumry. Other 19th Century scholars including Bunsen were alert to this ancient Language connection. As there are well known huge chronological mismatches scattered all through the Histories of the ancient Nations of the Near East and the Mediterranean, and considerable confusions in the Ancient History of Egypt, it appears logical that there must be something wrong with the Historical Data. As there are thousands of Egyptian Hieroglyphic texts, there should be no problem with the order and chronology of the History, if these textsare read correctly. The fact that there is confusion indicates that the Texts have not been properly read and automatically this means that the present accepted method of reading the Ancient Egyptian History is used as the yardstick to establish the dates and full chronology of all the other Ancient Nations. Wars, royal intermarriages, treaties of alliance and trade agreements, and so on, are all ""dated"" by reference directly or indirectly to Ancient Egypt. As the present accepted order and grotesquely distorted. Historical gaps, and dark ages, of five, six, and even eight hundred centuries litter the scenario, and every investigator who has dared to step into this arena has pointed the finger directly at Egyptian chronology. Basic analysis shows that the concept that the Hieroglyphs were written in Coptic is not correct, and the ""system"" of decipherment mainly involves guesswork and speculation using a strange cocktail mix of Coptic, Hamatic, and Hebrew. The indications are that J F Champollion claimed much more than he actually achieved. If the Texts are not deciphered and read correctly then the information in the Texts is not correctly understood. It is a simple task to test the possibility that the ancient Language of the Khumry in Britain that can be traced back through Etruria, the Aegean, Asia Minor, and Assyria, to old Israel, is the basic language of the Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphics. As a number of scholars have attempted to raise the issue of the chaos existing in the chronology of Ancient Egyptian History, and in 1990 Peter James and four other academic archaeologists published ""Centuries of Darkness"" and pointed out the historical mismatches, and later David Rohlpublished hi Pharaohs & Kings and made his TV series, and the problem of incorrect dates and order were clearly illustrated. Between 1950 and 1970 Immanuel Velikovsky published a series of books outlining the problems in ""Ages in Chaos, in Ramesses II & His Time, Oedipus & Ahkenaten, The Peoples of the Sea, etc."" Velikovsky was viciously attacked in a disgraceful exhibition of academic barbarism. Peter James et al and David Rohl, were quietly ignored. Nothing positive was done by the entrenched establishment who are willingly, deaf, dumb, and blind, to the situation.
The pre 307 BC Hieroglyphic texts can be read using the Khumric Language as their foundation. The results are consistent, coherent, and much more accurate than the Egyptospeak invented by Champollion. The order of the Egyptian Dynasties as currently presented is chaotic, and there are also many clear duplications. The indisputable fact is that the alleged 21st Dynasty of Egypt that is currently misdated at c 1050 - 950 BC is one and the same with the Family Dynasty of Alexander the Great in the 332 - 307 BC era. On this there can be no argument. The notion that there are no Hieroglyphic texts that identify Joseph, Benjamin, Moses, and Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, is a patent absurdity. These patriarchal figures have been shunted back in time from c 1550 BC to 2600 BC, from c 1350 BC to 22400 BC, and from c 950 BC to 1450 BC, and so on, and as a result they have been obscured.
Much of this disorder could and should have been resolved many years ago and there was a major scientific tool available to assist in this necessary process with the discovery of the Radio Carbon 14 dating techniques. Instead of puttingtheir house in order the denizens of the colleges and museums laboured mightily to discredit the Radio Carbon 14 dating methods, and it still is the common practice to discard and ignore the multitude of Radio CArbon 14 results that highlight the problems, and to claim that these readings ""must be"" contaminated or otherwise aberrant. The Researchers of this Project made their findings 20 years ago, beginning in 1984 when correct information cascaded out from readings of Hieroglyphic texts using Khumric, and only Khumric, as the base language. The savage treatment that was accorded to Velikovsky totally deterred them from making any of their work public. It is a sad fact that censorship does exist and persists as it has for centuries. Nonetheless there are clear Texts on Joseph, on Moses, and on Solomon & Sheba, and others. The rush to publish of the 19th Century has left a legacy of muddles and stagnation and it is time to allow a Defence to be heard against the unchallenged Allegation and Prosecution.",NA

A hero to the rebel, a devil to the Un Jeff Bussey walked briskly up the rutted wagon road toward Fort Leavenworth on his way to join the Union volunteers. It was 1861 in Linn County, Kansas, and Jeff was elated at the prospect of fighting for the North at last.

In the Indian country south of Kansas there was dread in the air; and the name, Stand Watie, was on every tongue. A hero to the rebel, a devil to the Union man, Stand Watie led the Cherokee Indian Nation fearlessly and successfully on savage raids behind the Union lines. Jeff came to know the Watie men only too well.

He was probably the only soldier in the West to see the Civil War from both sides and live to tell about it. Amid the roar of cannon and the swish of flying grape, Jeff learned what it meant to fight in battle. He learned how it felt never to have enough to eat, to forage for his food or starve. He saw the green fields of Kansas and Okla-homa laid waste by Watie's raiding parties, homes gutted, precious corn deliberately uprooted. He marched endlessly across parched, hot land, through mud and slashing rain, always hungry, always dirty and dog-tired.

And, Jeff, plain-spoken and honest, made friends and enemies. The friends were strong men like Noah Babbitt, the itinerant printer who once walked from Topeka to Galveston to see the magnolias in bloom; boys like Jimmy Lear, too young to carry a gun but old enough to give up his life at Cane Hill; ugly, big-eared Heifer, who made the best sourdough biscuits in the Choctaw country; and beautiful Lucy Washbourne, rebel to the marrow and proud of it. The enemies were men of another breed - hard-bitten Captain Clardy for one, a cruel officer with hatred for Jeff in his eyes and a dark secret on his soul.

This is a rich and sweeping novel-rich in its panorama of history; in its details so clear that the reader never doubts for a moment that he is there; in its dozens of different people, each one fully realized and wholly recognizable. It is a story of a lesser -- known part of the Civil War, the Western campaign, a part different in its issues and its problems, and fought with a different savagery. Inexorably it moves to a dramatic climax, evoking a brilliant picture of a war and the men of both sides who fought in it.",historical

A white woman, her hands gashed and bloody, stumbles into an inner-city emergency room and announces that she has just been carjacked by a black man. But then comes the horrifying twist: Her young son was asleep in the back seat, and he has now disappeared into the night.

So begins Richard Price's electrifying new novel, a tale set on the same turf--Dempsey, New Jersey--as Clockers. Assigned to investigate the case of Brenda Martin's missing child is detective Lorenzo Council, a local son of the very housing project targeted as the scene of the crime. Under a white-hot media glare, Lorenzo launches an all-out search for the abducted boy, even as he quietly explores a different possibility: Does Brenda Martin know a lot more about her son's disappearance than she's admitting?

Right behind Lorenzo is Jesse Haus, an ambitious young reporter from the city's evening paper. Almost immediately, Jesse suspects Brenda of hiding something. Relentlessly, she works her way into the distraught mother's fragile world, befriending her even as she looks for the chance to break the biggest story of her career.

As the search for the alleged carjacker intensifies, so does the simmering racial tension between Dempsey and its mostly white neighbor, Gannon. And when the Gannon police arrest a black man from Dempsey and declare him a suspect, the animosity between the two cities threatens to boil over into violence. With the media swarming and the mood turning increasingly ugly, Lorenzo must take desperate measures to get to the bottom of Brenda Martin's story.

At once a suspenseful mystery and a brilliant portrait of two cities locked in a death-grip of explosive rage, Freedomland reveals the heart of the urban American experience--dislocated, furious, yearning--as never before. Richard Price has created a vibrant, gut-wrenching masterpiece whose images will remain long after the final, devastating pages.

Twenty-nine-year-old Vanessa Cole i Part love story, part murder mystery, set on the cusp of the Second World War, Russell Banks's sharp-witted and deeply engaging new novel raises dangerous questions about class, politics, art, love, and madnessâand explores what happens when two powerful personalities, trapped at opposite ends of a social divide, begin to break the rules.

Twenty-nine-year-old Vanessa Cole is a wild, stunningly beautiful heiress, the adopted only child of a highly regarded New York brain surgeon and his socialite wife. Twice married, Vanessa has been scandalously linked to any number of rich and famous men. But on the night of July 4, 1936, at her parents' country home in a remote Adirondack Mountain enclave known as The Reserve, two events coincide to permanently alter the course of Vanessa's callow life: her father dies suddenly of a heart attack, and a mysteriously seductive local artist, Jordan Groves, blithely lands his Waco biplane in the pristine waters of the forbidden Upper Lake. . . .

Jordan's reputation has preceded him; he is internationally known as much for his exploits and conquests as for his paintings themselves, and, here in the midst of the Great Depression, his leftist loyalties seem suspiciously undercut by his wealth and elite clientele. But for all his worldly swagger, Jordan is as staggered by Vanessa's beauty and charm as she is by his defiant independence. He falls easy prey to her electrifying personality, but it is not long before he discovers that the heiress carries a dark, deeply scarring family secret. Emotionally unstable from the start, and further unhinged by her father's unexpected death, Vanessa begins to spin wildly out of control, manipulating and destroying the lives of all who cross her path.

Moving from the secluded beauty of the Adirondack wilderness to the skies above war-torn Spain and Fascist Germany, The Reserve is a clever, incisive, and passionately romantic novel of suspense that adds a new dimension to this acclaimed author's extraordinary repertoire.",fiction

I watched as my brother, Pablo Escobar, became the most successful criminal in history, but also a hero to many of the people of Colombia. My brother was loved and he was feared. Hundreds of thousands of people marched in his funeral procession, and certainly as many people celebrated his death.""
These are the words of Roberto Escobar-the top accountant for the notorious and deadly MedellÃ­n Cartel, and brother of Pablo Escobar, the most famous drug lord in history. At the height of his reign, Pablo's multibillion-dollar operation smuggled tons of cocaine each week into countries all over the world. Roberto and his ten accountants kept track of all the money. Only Pablo and Roberto knew where it was stashed-and what it bought.
And the amounts of money were simply staggering. According to Roberto, it cost $2,500 every month just to purchase the rubber bands needed to wrap the stacks of cash. The biggest problem was finding a place to store it: from secret compartments in walls and beneath swimming pools to banks and warehouses everywhere. There was so much money that Roberto would sometimes write off ten percent as ""spoilage,"" meaning either rats had chewed up the bills or dampness had ruined the cash.
Roberto writes about the incredible violence of the cartel, but he also writes of the humanitarian side of his brother. Pablo built entire towns, gave away thousands of houses, paid people's medical expenses, and built schools and hospitals. Yet he was responsible for the horrible deaths of thousands of people.
In short, this is the story of a world of riches almost beyond mortal imagination, and in his own words, Roberto Escobar tells all: building a magnificent zoo at Pablo's opulent home, the brothers' many escapes into the jungles of Colombia, devising ingenious methods to smuggle tons of cocaine into the United States, bribing officials with literally millions of dollars-and building a personal army to protect the Escobar family against an array of enemies sworn to kill them.
Few men in history have been more beloved-or despised-than Pablo Escobar. Now, for the first time, his story is told by the man who knew him best: his brother, Roberto.",non-fiction

Countess LuAnn de Lesseps knows firsthand that class is a state of mind, not a birthright. Raised in small-town Connecticut-half French Canadian, half Native American-she worked as a registered nurse before she started modeling. On her first trip to Europe, she was awed by the lifestyle of the Italians and stayed, eventually becoming a TV personality. Before long, she began a fairy-tale romance with Alexandre Count de Lesseps, of the Suez Canal dynasty, and married into a world of aristocrats.
She learned during her time in Europe that panache comes from within- not from an antiquated manual. Now she shares her savvy advice and her inspiring story in ""Class with the Countess,"" including:
?Elegance can most certainly be acquired.
?All of life is a seduction.
?You don't have to be rich and famous to have an unforgettable presence.

âHeâs a smart little mother******,Iâll give him that.â âKEITH RICHARDS on MICK JAGGER

Â IS he Jumpinâ Jack Flash? A Street Fighting Man? A Man of W #1 bestselling biographer Christopher Andersen provides this no-holds-barred biography as shocking and uncompromising as Mick Jagger himself, timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Rolling Stones and their world tour.

âHeâs a smart little mother******,Iâll give him that.â âKEITH RICHARDS on MICK JAGGER

Â IS he Jumpinâ Jack Flash? A Street Fighting Man? A Man of Wealth and Taste? All this, it turns out, and far more. By any definition, Mick Jagger is a force of nature, a complete originalâand undeniably one of the dominant cultural figures of our time. Swaggering, strutting, sometimes elusive, always spellbinding, he grabbed us by our collective throat a half-century ago andâunlike so many of his gifted peersânever let go.

For decades, Mick has jealously guarded his many shocking secretsâuntil now. As the Rolling Stones mark their 50th anniversary, journalist and #1 New York Times bestselling author Christopher Andersen tears the mask from rockâs most complex and enigmatic icon in a no-holds-barred biography as impossible to ignore as Jagger himself.

Based on interviews with friends, family members, fellow music legends, and industry insidersâas well as wives and legions of loversâMICK sheds new light on a man whose very name defines an era and candidly reveals:

âNew details about Jaggerâs jaw-dropping sexual exploits with more than four thousand women (including Madonna, Angelina Jolie, Carly Simon, Linda Ronstadt, Uma Thurman, and Franceâs First Lady Carla Bruni)âas well as his encounters with several of rockâs biggest male stars. Also, the day Mickâs wife Jerry Hall and Keith Richards pleaded with Jagger to seek treatment for sex addiction.

âThe backstage drama surrounding Mickâs knighthood, and Jaggerâs little-known ties to Britainâs Royal Family, including Prince William and Kate Middleton.

âWhat he really thinks of todayâs superstarsâincluding Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, BeyoncÃ©, Justin Timberlake, Kanye West, and Justin Bieber.

âNever-before-revealed, behind-the-scenes accounts of his often turbulent relationshipsâfrom his band-mates, ravenous groupies, and rabid fans to such intimates as Andy Warhol, John Lennon, Jackie Onassis, Bill Clinton, and others.

Â âCocaine, LSD, hashish, and speedâthe flabbergasting truth about the extent of Jaggerâs substance abuse, and how long it really went on.

âA rare glimpse into Mickâs business dealings and the killer instinct that has enabled him to amass a personal fortune well in excess of $400 million.

âThe stormy âmarriageâ between Mick and Keith that nearly ran aground over Keithâs searing commentsâand all the scandal, mayhem, excess, madness, and genius that went into making the Rolling Stones âthe worldâs greatest rock-and-roll band.â

Like its subject, this book is explosive and rivetingâthe definitive biography of a living legend who has kept us thrilled, confounded, and astounded.

He's ""The Showstopper"" who pushes his high-flying abilities to the limit in the squared circle, on ladders, and in steel cages. He's the company's first ""Grand Slam"" champion. And of course, he's forever the guy who conspired with WWE Chairman Vince McMahon to screw Bret ""Hitman"" Hart out of the WWE Championship in Montreal at ""Survivor Series"" on November 9, 1997.

But that's the side ""HBK"" has allowed you to see...until now. ""Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story"" introduces us to Michael Shawn Hickenbottom (""Everyone called me Shawn""), the youngest of four children whose ""really conservative upbringing"" made him shy and ""afraid that people wouldn't like me if I showed who I really was."" But upon discovering Southwest Championship Wrestling (SWCW) on TV one Saturday night, the preteen Hickenbottom realized instantly what he wanted to become, and years later would convince his father -- a colonel in the U.S. Air Force -- to let him drop out of college and pursue his dream.

From there, Hickenbottom fully recounts the events that led to ""Shawn Michaels's"" tutelage under Mexican wrestler Jose Lothario; working matches at Mid-South Wrestling under the guidance of Terry Taylor and the Rock 'n' Roll Express's Robert Gibson & RickyMorton; flying high with Marty Jannetty as ""The Midnight Rockers"" in the American Wrestling Association (AWA); and how a barroom confrontation in Buffalo almost prevented the tandem from ever joining the World Wrestling Federation. ""The Rockers"" would drop the ""Midnight"" and climb to the top of a tough World Wrestling Federation tag-team division in the late 1980s, though Michaels confesses how a ""fear of abandonment"" stagnated his desire to participate in singles competition, pressured him into a marriage he wasn't ready for, and drove him to drinking heavily and downing pills ""just to get through the day.""

With the impact of some ""Sweet Chin Music"" (Michaels's Superkick finisher), ""Heartbreak & Triumph"" expresses the ""sour note"" that dissolved Michaels's partnership with Jannetty and started his transformation into ""The Heartbreak Kid."" You'll learn firsthand of the ""unfair"" allegation that brought about HBK's classic Ladder match with Razor Ramon at ""WrestleMania X"" (""I lost the match, but I made my career""); the incident in Syracuse that set the stage for Shawn's unbelievable ""comeback"" victories at ""Royal Rumble 1996,"" and in the Iron Man WWE Championship match with Bret Hart at ""WrestleMania XII""; and how his escalating backstage feud with Hart inadvertently built toward the formation of ""D-Generation X,"" as well as the first-ever ""Hell in a Cell"" contest against The Undertaker at ""Badd Blood"" in October 1997.

Beyond the squared circle, Michaels clears the air about his days running with ""The Kliq"" -- Kevin Nash (""Diesel""), Scott Hall (""Razor Ramon""), Paul Levesque (""Triple H""), and Sean Waltman (""The 1-2-3 Kid"") -- their contributions to WWE's wildly successful ""Attitude""era, and the consequences of their uncharacteristic Madison Square Garden ""Curtain Call"" in May 1996. And for the first time anywhere, Michaels shoots completely straight about his role in ""the biggest scandal in wrestling history,"" the infamous ""Montreal Screwjob"" at ""Survivor Series 1997.""

While reliving the crippling back injury that forced him to retire in his prime following his WWE Championship loss at ""WrestleMania XIV,"" Michaels credits the new loves in his life -- his second wife Rebecca, his children, and his newfound faith -- with giving him the strength to kick his habit, recover physically, and make a jubilant return to the ring at ""SummerSlam 2002"" (in a Street Fight against best friend Triple H, no less).

Here is a story as unforgettable as it is simple. It reveals with fidelity, humor, and poignancy a woman's life in a bleak world where survival itself was a triumph and death as familiar as life. Peig said of her son Tomï¿½s, who was killed in a fall from a clifftop: ""Instead of his body being out in the broad ocean, there he was on the smooth detached stone. . . . laid out as expertly and as calmly as if twelve women had tended him."" Her own farewell to life had the same clear-eyed simplicity: ""People will yet walk into the graveyard where I'll be lying; I'll be stretched out quietly and the old world will have vanished.""

Peig died in 1958, when she was 85. She is buried a short distance from the townland where she was born, above the sea on the Dingle Peninsula, within sight of the Great Blasket Island.

Through this American edition, Peig will reach a new international audience. As Eoin McKiernan, President of the Irish American Cultural Institute, notes in his introduction, Peig has the ""quality of honesty and sincerity, of life lived at the bone."" Long loved in Ireland, this autobiography will now be seen for what it truly is--one of the great heart-cries of the Irish people.",cultural

When Ravi Kapoor, an over-worked London doctor, is driven beyond endurance by his obnoxious father-in-law, he asks his wife: 'Can't we just send him away somewhere? Somewhere far, far away.' His prayer seems to have been answered when his entrepreneurial cousin, Sonny, sets up a retirement home, recreating a lost corner of England in a converted guesthouse in Bangalore. Travel and set-up are inexpensive, staff willing and plentiful - and the British pensioners can enjoy the hot weather and take mango juice with their gin.
The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a brilliant comedy of manners, mixing acute observation with a deeper message about how different cultures cope in the modern world.

Their coaches, some of whom have spent nearly half a century in the game, watch from the dugout. In the bleachers, local fans call out from the same seats theyâve occupied year after year. And in the distance, smoke rises from the largest remaining factory in a town that once had more millionaires per capita than any other in America.
Â
Mann turns his eye on the players, the coaches, the fans, the radio announcer, the town, and finally on himself, a young man raised on baseball, driven to know what still draws him to the stadium. His voice is as fresh and funny as it is poignant, illuminating both the small triumphs and the harsh realities of minor-league ball. Part sports story, part cultural exploration, part memoir, Class A is a moving and unique study of why we play, why we watch, and why we remember.",sports

When you hear my story, perhaps you will think me a man unable to control his own hungersâ¦his own temptations. But I warn you that I am no such thing. I am simply a man who knows what he wants, and what he can't live without.

It is only fair to tell you that my clan is one descended from magic. I have learned these powers are both a blessing and a curse--for the magic that flows through my blood controls my fate utterly and completely.

When I first saw the beautiful Loris, I knew she was my unoliaeth, my oneness, the woman I am destined to unite with for all eternity. At that moment, I allowed my passion to lead me to do the unthinkable: I employed a forbidden magic to win Loris's heart.

How did I know that my error would lead to a black curse that still haunts me today? How could I have known that the curse would irrevocably cast Loris' affection for me to another man?

Now I am left to ponder how I might win Loris back--black curse be damned. I believe there must be a way. For while it is the darkest realms of magic that keeps Loris from becoming mine, there is another power at play: the undying, unending love of one man for one woman. And I pray that in the end, that will be enoughâ¦

Sarai was only fourteen when her mother uprooted her to live in Mexico with a notorious drug lord. Over time she forgot what it was like to live a normal life, but she never let go of her hope to escape the compound where she has been held for the past nine years.

Victor is a cold-blooded assassin who, like Sarai, has known only death and violence since he was a young boy. When Victor arrives at the compound to collect details and payment for a hit, Sarai sees him as her only opportunity for escape. But things donât go as planned and instead of finding transport back to Tucson, she finds herself free from one dangerous man and caught in the clutches of another.

While on the run, Victor strays from his primal nature as he succumbs to his conscience and resolves to help Sarai. As they grow closer, he finds himself willing to risk everything to keep her alive; even his relationship with his devoted brother and liaison, Niklas, who now like everyone else wants Sarai dead.

As Victor and Sarai slowly build a trust, the differences between them seem to lessen, and an unlikely attraction intensifies. But Victorâs brutal skills and experience may not be enough in the end to save her, as the power she unknowingly holds over him may ultimately be what gets her killed.

In The Interestings, Wolitzer follows these characters from the height of youth through middle age, as their talents, fortunes, and degrees of satisfaction diverge.

The kind of creativity that is rewarded at age fifteen is not always enough to propel someone through life at age thirty; not everyone can sustain, in adulthood, what seemed so special in adolescence.

Her friend Jonah, a gifted musician, stops playing the guitar and becomes an engineer. But Ethan and Ash, Jules's now-married best friends, become shockingly successfulâtrue to their initial artistic dreams, with the wealth and access that allow those dreams to keep expanding.

A very modern man, without political convictions or religious beliefs, he vaguely hopes to find fulfillment in sexual love. No one is spared Kureishi's cold, penetrating gaze or lacerating pen. ""She thinks she's feminist, but she's just bad-tempered,"" the unnamed narrator says of his abandoned wife. A male friend advises him, ""Marriage is a battle, a terrible journey, a season in hell, and a reason for living.""
At the heart of Intimacy is this terrible paradox: ""You don't stop loving someone just because you hate them."" Male readers will wince with recognition at the narrator's hatred of entrapment and domesticity, and his implacable urge towards freedom, escape, even loneliness. Female readers may find it a truly horrific revelation. Kureishi is only telling it like it is, in staccato sentences of pinpoint accuracy.

The basis for the movie The Fifth Estate (starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange), this eye-opening account by Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the former spokesman of WikiLeaks, reveals never-disclosed details about the inner workings of the increasingly controversial organization that has struck fear into governments and business organizations worldwide and prompted the Pentagon to convene a 120-man task force.

Under the pseudonym Daniel Schmitt, Domscheit-Berg was the effective No. 2 at WikiLeaks and the organizationâs most public face, after Julian Assange. In this book, he reveals the evolution, finances, and inner tensions of the whistleblower organization, beginning with his first meeting with Assange in December 2007. He also describes what led to his September 2010 withdrawal from WikiLeaks, including his disenchantment with the organizationâs lack of transparency, its abandonment of political neutrality, and Assangeâs increasing concentration of power. What has been made public so far about WikiLeaks is only a small fraction of the truth. With Domscheit-Bergâs insider knowledge, he is uniquely able to tell the full story. A computer scientist who worked in IT security prior to devoting himself full-time to WikiLeaks, he remains committed to freedom of information on the Internet.

Only, Michaelaâs Archangelsâher brothers and sisters in Heavenâbetray her. And when the fallen attack the sanctuary in the skies through the gates Michaela inadvertently left open, the holy angels accuse Michaela of planning the invasion.

One simple mistake with a thousand consequences.

Dragged to Earth by an Archangel turned fallen, Michaela will do anything to return to Heaven and save it. In her fervor, she kills the Archangelâsomething no angel has ever done before. Wingless, without any hope, Michaela welcomes death when an unlikely human ally, Clark, finds her. With the help of Clark and Gabriel, an innocent Archangel whose friendship deepens into something far more torrid and unexpected on Earth, Michaela must prove the holy angels have their own plan for Heaven, and it is one that may prove to be the End of the Days.

It may be too late to save herself, but Michaela is the only one who knows the truth about the holy angels. If she fails, she may never be able to return to Heaven. But even that may be a hopeless dream.",fantasy

It was an even bigger surprise when they beat the seventh grade and the eighth grade, too. And when they went on to even greater victories, everyone began to ask: How did it happen?

It happened at least partly because Noah had been the best man (quite by accident) at the wedding of Ethan's grandmother and Nadia's grandfather. It happened because Nadia discovered that she could not let a lot of baby turtles die. It happened when Ethan could not let Julian face disaster alone. And it happened because Julian valued something important in himself and saw in the other three something he also valued.

Mrs. Olinski, returning to teaching after having been injured in an automobile accident, found that her Academic Bowl team became her answer to finding confidence and success. What she did not know, at least at first, was that her team knew more than she did the answer to why they had been chosen.

The discovery of penicillin in 1928 ushered in a new age in medicine. But it took a team of Oxford scientists headed by Howard Florey and Ernst Chain four more years to develop it as the first antibiotic, and the most important family of drugs in the twentieth century. At once the world was transformedâmajor bacterial scourges such as blood poisoning and pneumonia, scarlet fever and diphtheria, gonorrhea and syphilis were defeated as penicillin helped to foster not only a medical revolution but a sexual one as well. In his wonderfully engaging book, acclaimed author Eric Lax tells the real story behind the discovery and why it took so long to develop the drug.Â He reveals the reasons why credit for penicillin wasÂ misplaced, and why this astonishing achievement garnered a Nobel Prize but no financial rewards for Alexander Fleming, Florey, and his team.

The Mold in Dr. Floreyâs Coat is the compelling story of the passage of medicine from one era to the next and of the eccentric individuals whose participation in this extraordinary accomplishment has, until now, remained largely unknown.",science

Three brothers tear their way through childhood â smashing tomatoes all over each other, building kites from trash, hiding out when their parents do battle, tiptoeing around the house as their mother sleeps off her graveyard shift. Paps and Ma are from Brooklyn â heâs Puerto Rican, sheâs white â and their love is a serious, dangerous thing that makes and unmakes a family many times.

Life in this family is fierce and absorbing, full of chaos and heartbreak and the euphoria of belonging completely to one another.

As an illustrator and journalist, Sugarman covered the nearly one thousand student volunteers who traveled to the Mississippi Delta to assist black citizens in the South in registering to vote. He interviewed these activists, along with local civil rights leaders and black and white residents not directly involved in the movement, and drew the people and events that made the summer one of the most heroic chapters in Americaâs long march toward racial justice.

In We Had Sneakers, They Had Guns, Sugarman chronicles the sacrifices, tragedies, and triumphs of that unprecedented moment in our nationâs history. Two white students and one black student were slain in the struggle, many were beaten and hundreds arrested, and churches and homes were burned to the ground by the opponents of equality. Yet the example of Freedom Summerâ whites united with heroic black Mississippians to challenge apartheidâresonated across the nation. The United States Congress was finally moved to pass the civil rights legislation that enfranchised the millions of black Americans who had been waiting for equal rights for a century.

Blending oral history with memoir, We Had Sneakers, They Had Guns draws the reader into the lives of Sugarmanâs subjects, showing the passion and naivetÃ© of the volunteers, the bravery of the civil rights leaders, and the candid, sometimes troubling reactions of the black and white Delta residents.

""There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed . . .""

On a brisk autumn day in 1686, eighteen-year-old Nella Oortman arrives in Amsterdam to begin a new life as the wife of illustrious merchant trader Johannes Brandt. But her new home, while splendorous, is not welcoming. Johannes is kind yet distant, always locked in his study or at his warehouse office--leaving Nella alone with his sister, the sharp-tongued and forbidding Marin.

But Nella's world changes when Johannes presents her with an extraordinary wedding gift: a cabinet-sized replica of their home. To furnish her gift, Nella engages the services of a miniaturist--an elusive and enigmatic artist whose tiny creations mirror their real-life counterparts in eerie and unexpected ways . . .

Johannes' gift helps Nella to pierce the closed world of the Brandt household. But as she uncovers its unusual secrets, she begins to understand--and fear--the escalating dangers that await them all. In this repressively pious society where gold is worshipped second only to God, to be different is a threat to the moral fabric of society, and not even a man as rich as Johannes is safe. Only one person seems to see the fate that awaits them. Is the miniaturist the key to their salvation . . . or the architect of their destruction?

An investment banker approaching forty, his career collapsing and his marriage unraveling, receives a surprise visitor at his West LondonÂ town house. Confronting the disheveled figure of a South Asian male carrying a backpack, the banker recognizes a long-lost college friend, a mathematics prodigy who disappeared many years earlier under mysterious circumstances. The friend has resurfaced with a confession of unsettling power.

Zia Haider Rahman takes us on a journey of exhilarating scope, ranging over Kabul, London, New York, Islamabad, Oxford, and Princeton and dealing with love,Â belonging, finance, science, and war. Its framework is an age-old story:Â the friendship of two men and the betrayal of one by the other, both of them desperate in their different ways to climb clear of their wrong beginnings. Set against the breaking of nations and beneath the clouds of economic recession, the novel chronicles the lives of people carrying unshakable legacies of class, culture, and faith as they struggle to tame their futures.Â

In the Light of What We Know is by turns tender, intimate, and panoramic, telescoping the great upheavals of our young century into a first novel of rare ambition and profundity.

In An Assembly ""She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.""

So begins the timeless romance of Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen's classic novel is beloved by millions, but little is revealed in the book about the mysterious and handsome hero, Mr. Darcy. And so the question has long remained: Who is Fitzwilliam Darcy?

In An Assembly Such as This, Pamela Aidan finally answers that long-standing question. In this first book of her Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman trilogy, she reintroduces us to Darcy during his visit to Hertfordshire with his friend Charles Bingley and reveals Darcy's hidden perspective on the events of Pride and Prejudice. As Darcy spends more time at Netherfield supervising Bingley and fending off Miss Bingley's persistent advances, his unwilling attraction to Elizabeth growsâas does his concern about her relationship with his nemesis, George Wickham.

Setting the story vividly against the colorful historical and political background of the Regency, Aidan writes in a style comfortably at home with Austen but with a wit and humor very much her own. Aidan adds her own cast of fascinating characters to those in Austen's original, weaving a rich tapestry from Darcy's past and present.

As the Empire reels from its critical defeats at the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Allianceânow a fledgling New Republicâpresses its advantage by hunting down the enemyâs scattered forces before they can regroup and retaliate. But above the remote planet Akiva, an ominous show of the enemyâs strength is unfolding. Out on a lone reconnaissance mission, pilot Wedge Antilles watches Imperial Star Destroyers gather like birds of prey circling for a kill, but heâs taken captive before he can report back to the New Republic leaders.

Meanwhile, on the planetâs surface, former rebel fighter Norra Wexley has returned to her native worldâwar weary, ready to reunite with her estranged son, and eager to build a new life in some distant place. But when Norra intercepts Wedge Antillesâs urgent distress call, she realizes her time as a freedom fighter is not yet over. What she doesnât know is just how close the enemy isâor how decisive and dangerous her new mission will be.

Determined to preserve the Empireâs power, the surviving Imperial elite are converging on Akiva for a top-secret emergency summitâto consolidate their forces and rally for a counterstrike. But they havenât reckoned on Norra and her newfound alliesâher technical-genius son, a Zabrak bounty hunter, and a reprobate Imperial defectorâwho are prepared to do whatever they must to end the Empireâs oppressive reign once and for all.",media-tie-in
